<p>Unregister-Event  cancels an event subscription that was created by using the Register-EngineEvent, Register-ObjectEvent, or Register-WmiEvent cmdlet.<br>
<br>
When an event subscription is canceled, the event subscriber is deleted from the session and the subscribed events 
are no longer added to the event queue. When a subscription to an event created with New-Event is cancelled, the new event is also deleted from the session. <br>
<br>
Unregister-Event does not delete events from the event queue. To delete events, use <a href="remove-event.html"> Remove-Event</a></p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Cancel the event subscription with a source identifier of &quot;ProcessStarted&quot;:</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:\&gt; unregister-event -sourceIdentifier ProcessStarted</span><br>
<br>
  Cancel all event subscriptions in the session.:</p>
<p class="code">PS C:\&gt; get-eventsubscriber -force | unregister-event -force</p>

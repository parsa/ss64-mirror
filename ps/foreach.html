</head><body><h1>ForEach (loop statement) </h1>
<p>Loop through a set of input objects and perform an operation (execute a block of statements) against each. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      ForEach (<i>item</i> <b>In</b> <i>collection</i>) {<i>ScriptBlock</i>}

key
   <i>item</i>         A variable to hold the current item
   <i>collection</i>   A collection of objects e.g. filenames, registry keys, servernames
   <i>ScriptBlock</i>  A block of script to run against each object.  </pre>
<p>The <i>collection</i> will be evaluated and stored as an array in memory before the <i>scriptblock</i> is executed. </p>
<p>The <span class="code">foreach</span> statement does not use pipelining (unlike <a href="foreach-object.html">ForEach-Object </a> ) If you use <span class="code">foreach</span> in a command pipeline PowerShell will actually run the <span class="code">foreach</span> alias that calls <span class="code">ForEach-Object</span>.</p>
<p>Use the <span class="code">ForEach</span> statement when the <i>collection </i>of objects is small enough that it can be loaded into memory.<br>
Use the <a href="foreach-object.html">ForEach-Object</a> cmdlet when you want to pass only one object at a time through the pipeline, minimising memory usage. In most cases <span class="code">ForEach</span> will run faster than <span class="code">ForEach-Object</span>, there are exceptions, such as starting multiple background jobs. If in doubt test both options with <a href="measure-command.html">Measure-Command</a>.</p>
<p>In PowerShell 4.0 and later, the <a href="foreach-method.html">ForEach method</a> provides even faster performance.</p>

<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Loop through an array of strings:</p>
<p class="code">&nbsp;$trees = @("Alder","Ash","Birch","Cedar",&quot;Chestnut&quot;,&quot;Elm&quot;)<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;foreach ($tree in $trees) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"$tree = " + $tree.length<br>
&nbsp;}</p>
<p>Loop through a collection of the numbers, echo each number unless the number is 2: </p>
<p><span class="code">&nbsp;foreach ($num in 1,2,3,4,5) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if ($num -eq 2) { continue } ; $num<br>
&nbsp;}</span><br>
<br>Loop through a collection of .txt files:</p>
<p class="code">  foreach ($file in get-ChildItem *.txt) {<br>
    Echo $file.name<br>
  }</p>

Key
   -Credential <i>PSCredential</i>
       A user account that has permission to perform this action.
       The default is the current user.

       Type a user name, such as &quot;User64&quot; or &quot;Domain64\User64&quot;, or enter a
       PSCredential object, such as one generated by Get-Credential.
       If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

       apart from security settings.

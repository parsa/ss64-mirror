<p>When Unregister-ScheduledJob deletes or &quot;unregisters&quot; a scheduled job, it deletes the directory for the scheduled      job (  <span class="code">$home\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs</span>), which contains the XML file      that defines the scheduled job, the job execution history, and all job results. This action also deletes the job      from Task Scheduler.          </p>
<p>Unregister-ScheduledJob deletes only the scheduled jobs that are created by using  <a href="register-scheduledjob.html">Register-ScheduledJob</a> . It does not delete scheduled jobs that are created in <a href="../nt/schtasks.html">Task Scheduler</a>.          </p>
<p>Use the parameters of Unregister-ScheduledJob to delete scheduled jobs by ID or name, or pipe scheduled      jobs from <a href="get-scheduledjob.html">Get-ScheduledJob</a> to Unregister-ScheduledJob.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Delete the scheduled job called SS64Job:</p>
<p><span class="code">C:\PS> Unregister-ScheduledJob SS64Job</span></p>
<p>Delete all (PowerShell) scheduled jobs:</p>
<p> <span class="code">C:\PS> Get-ScheduledJob | Unregister-ScheduledJob -Force</span><br>
<br>
Delete a scheduled job on a remote computer:</p>
<p class="code">PS C:\&gt; Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server64 { Unregister-ScheduledJob -Name SS64*}</p>

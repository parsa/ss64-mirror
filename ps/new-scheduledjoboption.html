<pre>Syntax
      New-ScheduledJobOption [-ContinueIfGoingOnBattery] [-DoNotAllowDemandStart] [-HideInTaskScheduler]
            [-IdleDuration <i>TimeSpan</i>] [-IdleTimeout <i>TimeSpan</i>] [-MultipleInstancePolicy <i>TaskMultipleInstancePolicy</i>]
               [-RequireNetwork] [-RestartOnIdleResume] [-RunElevated] [-StartIfIdle]
                  [-StartIfOnBattery] [-StopIfGoingOffIdle] [-WakeToRun] [<a href="common.html"><i>CommonParameters</i></a>]

Key
   -ContinueIfGoingOnBattery
       Do not stop the scheduled job if the computer switches to battery power (disconnects from AC power) while the 
       job is running. By default, scheduled jobs stop when the computer disconnects from AC power.

       The ContinueIfGoingOnBattery parameter sets the value of the StopIfGoingOnBatteries property of scheduled jobs 
       to True.

   -DoNotAllowDemandStart
       Start the job only when it is triggered. Users cannot start the job manually, such as by using the Run feature 
       in Task Scheduler.

       This parameter only affects Task Scheduler. It does not prevents users from using the Start-Job cmdlet to 
       start the job.

       The DoNotAllowDemandStart parameter sets the value of the DoNotAllowDemandStart property of scheduled jobs to 
       True.

   -HideInTaskScheduler
       Do not display the job in Task Scheduler. This value affects only the computer on which the job runs. By 
       default, scheduled tasks appear in Task Scheduler.

       Even if a task is hidden, users can display the task by selecting the "Show hidden tasks" view option in Task 
       Scheduler.

       The HideInTaskScheduler parameter sets the value of the ShowInTaskScheduler property of scheduled jobs to 
       False.

   -IdleDuration <i>TimeSpan</i>
       Specifies how long the computer must be idle before the job starts. The default value is 10 minutes. If the 
       computer is not idle for the specified duration before the value of IdleTimeout expires, the scheduled job 
       does not run until the next scheduled time, if any.

       Enter a timespan object, such as one generated by the New-TimeSpan cmdlet, or enter a value in 
       <i>hours:minutes:seconds</i> format that is automatically converted to a timespan object

       To enable this value, use the StartIfIdle parameter. By default, the StartIfNotIdle property of scheduled jobs 
       is set to True and Windows PowerShell ignores the IdleDuration and IdleTimeout values.

   -IdleTimeout <i>TimeSpan</i>
       Specifies how long the computer must be idle before the job starts. The default value is 10 minutes. If the 
       computer is not idle for the specified duration before the value of IdleTimeout expires, the scheduled job 
       does not run until the next scheduled time, if any.

       Enter a timespan object, such as one generated by the New-TimeSpan cmdlet, or enter a value in 
       <i>hours:minutes:seconds</i> format  that is automatically converted to a timespan object.

       To enable this value, use the StartIfIdle parameter. By default, the StartIfNotIdle property of scheduled jobs 
       is set to True and Windows PowerShell ignores the IdleDuration and IdleTimeout values.

   -InputObject <i>ScheduledJobOptions</i>
       Specifies the job options. Enter a variable that contains  ScheduledJobOptions objects or type a command or 
       expression that gets ScheduledJobOptions objects, such as a Get-ScheduledJobOption command. You can also pipe 
       a ScheduledJobOptions object to Set-ScheduledJobOption.

   -MultipleInstancePolicy <i>TaskMultipleInstancePolicy</i>
       Determines how the system responds to a request to start an instance of a scheduled job while another instance 
       of the job is running. The default value is IgnoreNew.

       Valid values are:
        
       -- IgnoreNew: The new job instance is ignored. This is the default value.
        
       -- Parallel: The new job instance starts immediately.
        
       -- Queue: The new job instance starts as soon as the current instance completes.
        
       -- StopExisting: The current instance of the job stop and the new instance starts.
        
       To run the job, all conditions for the job schedule must be met. For example, if the conditions that are set 
       by the RequireNetwork, IdleDuration and IdleTimeout parameters are not satisfied, the job instance is not 
       started, regardless of the value of this parameter.
 
   -RequireNetwork
       Runs the scheduled job only when network connections are available.

       If you specify this parameter and the network is not available at the scheduled start time, the job does not 
       run until the next scheduled start time, if any.

       The RequireNetwork parameter sets the value of the RunWithoutNetwork property of scheduled jobs to False.

   -RestartOnIdleResume
       Restarts a scheduled job when the computer becomes idle. This parameter works with the StopIfGoingOffIdle 
       parameter, which suspends a running scheduled job if the computer becomes active (leaves the idle state).

       The RestartOnIdleResume parameter sets the value of the RestartOnIdleResume property of scheduled jobs to True.

   -RunElevated
       Runs the scheduled job with the permissions of a member of the Administrators group on the computer on which 
       the job runs.

       To enable a scheduled job to run with Administrator permissions, use the Credential parameter of 
       Register-ScheduledJob to provide explicit credential for the job.

       The RunElevated parameter sets the value of the RunElevated property of scheduled jobs to True.

   -StartIfIdle
       Starts the scheduled job if the computer has been idle for the time specified by the IdleDuration parameter 
       before the time specified by the IdleTimeout parameter expires.

       By default, the IdleDuration and IdleTimeout parameters are ignored and the job starts at the scheduled start 
       time even if the computer is busy.

       If you specify this parameter and the computer is busy (not idle) at the scheduled start time, the job does 
       not run until the next scheduled start time, if any.

       The StartIfIdle parameter sets the value of the StartIfNotIdle property of scheduled jobs to False.

   -StartIfOnBattery
       Starts the scheduled job even if the computer is running on batteries at the scheduled start time. The default 
       value is False.

       The StartIfOnBattery parameter sets the value of the StartIfOnBatteries property of scheduled jobs to True.

   -StopIfGoingOffIdle
       Suspends a running scheduled job if the computer becomes active (not idle) while the job is running.

       By default, a scheduled job that is suspended when the computer becomes active resumes when the computer 
       becomes idle again. To change this default behavior, use the RestartOnIdleResume parameter.

       The StopIfGoingOffIdle parameter sets the value of the StopIfGoingOffIdle property of scheduled jobs to True.

   -WakeToRun
       Wakes the computer from a Hibernate or Sleep state at the scheduled start time so it can run the job. By 
       default, if the computer is in a Hibernate or Sleep state at the scheduled start time, the job does not run.

       The WakeToRun parameter sets the value of the WakeToRun property of scheduled jobs to True.

   <a href="common.html">CommonParameters</a>:
       -Verbose, -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -WarningAction, -WarningVariable,
       -OutBuffer -PipelineVariable, -OutVariable.</pre>
<p>Use the ScheduledJobOptions object that New-ScheduledJobOption returns to set job options for a new or      existing scheduled job. Alternatively, you can set job options by using the Get-ScheduledJobOption cmdlet to get      the job options of an existing scheduled job or by using a hash table value to represent the job options.          </p>
<p>Without parameters, New-ScheduledJobOption generates an object that contains the default values for all of the      options. Because all of the properties except for the JobDefinition property can be edited, you can use the      resulting object as a template, and create standard option objects for your enterprise.          </p>
<p>When creating scheduled jobs and setting scheduled job options, review the default values of all scheduled job      options. Scheduled jobs run only when all conditions set for their execution are satisfied.</p>
<p>The scheduled job options determine how the job runs when it is started by Task Scheduler. <br>
These options do not      apply when you use <a href="start-job.html">Start-Job</a>  to start a scheduled job.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Create a scheduled job option object with default values:</p>
<pre><span class="code">PS C:\> New-ScheduledJobOption</span>
    StartIfOnBatteries     : False
    StopIfGoingOnBatteries : True
    WakeToRun              : False
    StartIfNotIdle         : True
    StopIfGoingOffIdle     : False
    RestartOnIdleResume    : False
    IdleDuration           : 00:10:00
    IdleTimeout            : 01:00:00
    ShowInTaskScheduler    : True
    RunElevated            : False
    RunWithoutNetwork      : True
    DoNotAllowDemandStart  : False
    MultipleInstancePolicy : Ignore
    NewJobDefinition       :</pre>
<p>Create a scheduled job option object with custom values:</p>
<pre><span class="code">PS C:\></span> New-ScheduledJobOption -RequireNetwork -StartIfOnBattery</pre>
<p> Create a ScheduledJobOptions object with the RunElevated parameter:</p>
<p class="code">PS C:\&gt; $RunAsAdmin = New-ScheduledJobOption -RunElevated</p>
<p>Create  a new scheduled job using the $RunAsAdmin variable for the      ScheduledJobOption parameter:</p>
<p class="code">PS C:\&gt; Register-ScheduledJob -Name Backup -FilePath D:\Scripts\Backup.ps1 -Trigger $Mondays -ScheduledJobOption      $RunAsAdmin</p>

Key
   -psDrive
       Get the current location in the specified PowerShell drive. 

       For example, if you are in the Certificate: drive, find the current location in 
       the C: drive.

   -psProvider 
       Get the current location in the drive supported by the specified PowerShell provider. 
       For example, if you are in the C: drive, find the current location in
       the Registry via the PowerShell Registry provider.

       If the specified provider supports more than one drive, Get-Location will 
       returns the location on the most recently accessed drive.

       To add paths to the default stack, use Push-Location.

   -stackName

   -UseTransaction
       Include the command in the active <a href="syntax-transactions.html">transaction</a>.

<p>Standard <a href="get-alias.html">Aliases</a> for Get-Location:<span class="code"> pwd, <b>gl</b></span></p>
<p>Get-Location  gets an object that represents the current directory, much like the pwd (print working directory) command. <br>
<br>
When you move between  PowerShell drives,  PowerShell will retain your location in each drive. Get-Location can be used to find your location in each drive.</p>
<p>PowerShell Location is <b>not</b> the same as the process Current Directory. This means that non PowerShell utilities such as <a href="../nt/robocopy.html">RoboCopy</a> will default to the old style Current Directory, which is held as a static <a href="syntax-env.html">environment</a> variable <span class="code">[environment]::CurrentDirectory</span></p>
<p>Read the System.Environment's static CurrentDirectory property:<br>
<span class="code">[environment]::CurrentDirectory</span></p>
<p>Set the System.Environment's static CurrentDirectory property:<br>
<span class="code">[environment]::CurrentDirectory = &quot;C:\music\mp3&quot;</span></p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Display the current working location:</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:\&gt; get-location</span><br>
<br>Display the current directory for drive C: even when working in the registry:</p>
<p class="code">PS C:\&gt; set-location C:\Windows<br>
PS C:\&gt; set-location HKLM:\Software\Microsoft<br>
PS C:\&gt; get-location -psdrive c</p>

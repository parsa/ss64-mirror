<p>Resume a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) transfer job.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      Resume-BitsTransfer [-BitsJob] <i>BitsJob</i>[] [-Asynchronous]
         [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<a href="common.html"><i>CommonParameters</i></a>]

Key
   -BitsJob <i>BitsJob</i>[]
       The BITS transfer job(s) to resume.
       Pipe a value to this parameter from other cmdlets that return BitsJob objects, such as Get-BitsTransfer.

   -Asynchronous
       Allow the BITS transfer job to be processed in the background.
       The command prompt reappears immediately after the BITS transfer job is resumed.
       The returned BitsJob object can be used to monitor job status and progress.

   -Confirm
       Prompt for confirmation before executing the command.

   -WhatIf
       Describe what would happen if you executed the command, without actually executing the command.

   <a href="common.html">CommonParameters</a>:
       -Verbose, -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -WarningAction, -WarningVariable,
       -OutBuffer -OutVariable.</pre>
<p>Resume-BitsTransfer  resumes one or more suspended BITS transfer jobs. If the BITS transfer is already in process, the cmdlet does nothing. <br>
View the current state of a transfer job with <a href="get-bitstransfer.html">Get-BitsTransfer</a>.</p>
<p>By default,  Resume-BitsTransfer  restarts the transfer job synchronously even if the original job was specified as an asynchronous transfer job. to restart the transfer job as an asynchronous transfer, use the -Asynchronous parameter. This behavior may be used to convert an asynchronous transfer job into a synchronous transfer job. </p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Resume all the BITS transfer jobs that are owned by the current user:</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:\&gt; Get-BitsTransfer | Resume-BitsTransfer</span></p>
<p>Resume  the BITS transfer job called AppPatchesMarch:</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:\&gt; Get-BitsTransfer -Name AppPatchesMarch | Resume-BitsTransfer</span></p>
<p>Create a new BITS transfer job (suspended) add a file to it, and then resume the job:</p>
<pre>PS C:\&gt; $newJob = Start-BitsTransfer -DisplayName &quot;SS64Job&quot; -Suspended
PS C:\&gt; Add-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $newJob -ClientFileName C:\demo\file1.txt -ServerFileName http://example.com/file1.txt
PS C:\&gt; Resume-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $newJob -Asynchronous</pre>

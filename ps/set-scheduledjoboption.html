      Set-ScheduledJobOption [-InputObject] <i>ScheduledJobOptions</i> [-ContinueIfGoingOnBattery]
         [-DoNotAllowDemandStart] [-HideInTaskScheduler] [-IdleDuration <i>TimeSpan</i>]
            [-IdleTimeout <i>TimeSpan</i>] [-MultipleInstancePolicy <i>TaskMultipleInstancePolicy</i>]
               [-PassThru] [-RequireNetwork] [-RestartOnIdleResume] [-RunElevated] [-StartIfIdle]
                  [-StartIfOnBattery] [-StopIfGoingOffIdle] [-WakeToRun] [<a href="common.html"><i>CommonParameters</i></a>]

Key
   <i>ScheduledJobOptions</i>
       To change the options of a scheduled job, use <a href="get-scheduledjoboption.html">Get-ScheduledJobOption</a> to get the current job options of a
       scheduled job. Then, pipe the options to Set-ScheduledJobOption or save the options in a variable and use
       the -InputObject parameter to identify the options. Use the remaining parameters of Set-ScheduledJobOption
       to change the job options. To turn on a job option, use the parameter that sets that option.
       To turn off an option, type the parameter name, a colon (:), and $false.
       For example, to turn off the -RunElevated option, type -RunElevated:$false.

   -ContinueIfGoingOnBattery
       Do not stop the scheduled job if the computer switches to battery power (disconnects from AC power) while the 
       job is running. By default, scheduled jobs stop when the computer disconnects from AC power.

       The ContinueIfGoingOnBattery parameter sets the value of the StopIfGoingOnBatteries property of scheduled jobs 
       to True.

   -DoNotAllowDemandStart
       Start the job only when it is triggered. Users cannot start the job manually, such as by using the Run feature 
       in Task Scheduler.

       This parameter only affects Task Scheduler. It does not prevents users from using the Start-Job cmdlet to 
       start the job.

       The DoNotAllowDemandStart parameter sets the value of the DoNotAllowDemandStart property of scheduled jobs to 
       True.

   -HideInTaskScheduler
       Do not display the job in Task Scheduler. This value affects only the computer on which the job runs. By 
       default, scheduled tasks appear in Task Scheduler.

       Even if a task is hidden, users can display the task by selecting the "Show hidden tasks" view option in Task 
       Scheduler.

       The HideInTaskScheduler parameter sets the value of the ShowInTaskScheduler property of scheduled jobs to 
       False.

   -IdleDuration <i>TimeSpan</i>
       Specifies how long the computer must be idle before the job starts. The default value is 10 minutes. If the 
       computer is not idle for the specified duration before the value of IdleTimeout expires, the scheduled job 
       does not run until the next scheduled time, if any.

       Enter a timespan object, such as one generated by the New-TimeSpan cmdlet, or enter a value in 
       <i>hours:minutes:seconds</i> format that is automatically converted to a timespan object

       To enable this value, use the StartIfIdle parameter. By default, the StartIfNotIdle property of scheduled jobs 
       is set to True and Windows PowerShell ignores the IdleDuration and IdleTimeout values.

   -IdleTimeout <i>TimeSpan</i>
       Specifies how long the computer must be idle before the job starts. The default value is 10 minutes. If the 
       computer is not idle for the specified duration before the value of IdleTimeout expires, the scheduled job 
       does not run until the next scheduled time, if any.

       Enter a timespan object, such as one generated by the New-TimeSpan cmdlet, or enter a value in 
       <i>hours:minutes:seconds</i> format  that is automatically converted to a timespan object.

       To enable this value, use the StartIfIdle parameter. By default, the StartIfNotIdle property of scheduled jobs 
       is set to True and Windows PowerShell ignores the IdleDuration and IdleTimeout values.

   -InputObject <i>ScheduledJobOptions</i>
       Specifies the job options. Enter a variable that contains  ScheduledJobOptions objects or type a command or 
       expression that gets ScheduledJobOptions objects, such as a Get-ScheduledJobOption command. You can also pipe 
       a ScheduledJobOptions object to Set-ScheduledJobOption.

   -MultipleInstancePolicy <i>TaskMultipleInstancePolicy</i>
       Determines how the system responds to a request to start an instance of a scheduled job while another instance 
       of the job is running. The default value is IgnoreNew.

       Valid values are:

       -- IgnoreNew: The new job instance is ignored. This is the default value.

       -- Parallel: The new job instance starts immediately.

       -- Queue: The new job instance starts as soon as the current instance completes.

       -- StopExisting: The current instance of the job stop and the new instance starts.

       To run the job, all conditions for the job schedule must be met. For example, if the conditions that are set 
       by the RequireNetwork, IdleDuration and IdleTimeout parameters are not satisfied, the job instance is not 
       started, regardless of the value of this parameter.

   -PassThru
       Returns the job options that changed. By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

   -RequireNetwork
       Runs the scheduled job only when network connections are available.

       If you specify this parameter and the network is not available at the scheduled start time, the job does not 
       run until the next scheduled start time, if any.

       The RequireNetwork parameter sets the value of the RunWithoutNetwork property of scheduled jobs to False.

   -RestartOnIdleResume
       Restarts a scheduled job when the computer becomes idle. This parameter works with the StopIfGoingOffIdle 
       parameter, which suspends a running scheduled job if the computer becomes active (leaves the idle state).

       The RestartOnIdleResume parameter sets the value of the RestartOnIdleResume property of scheduled jobs to True.

   -RunElevated
       Run the scheduled job with the <a href="syntax-elevate.html">permissions</a> of a member of the Administrators group on the computer on which 
       the job runs.

       To enable a scheduled job to run with Administrator permissions, use the Credential parameter of 
       Register-ScheduledJob to provide explicit credential for the job.

       The RunElevated parameter sets the value of the RunElevated property of scheduled jobs to True.

   -StartIfIdle
       Starts the scheduled job if the computer has been idle for the time specified by the IdleDuration parameter 
       before the time specified by the IdleTimeout parameter expires.

       By default, the IdleDuration and IdleTimeout parameters are ignored and the job starts at the scheduled start 
       time even if the computer is busy.

       If you specify this parameter and the computer is busy (not idle) at the scheduled start time, the job does 
       not run until the next scheduled start time, if any.

       The StartIfIdle parameter sets the value of the StartIfNotIdle property of scheduled jobs to False.

   -StartIfOnBattery
       Starts the scheduled job even if the computer is running on batteries at the scheduled start time. The default 
       value is False.

       The StartIfOnBattery parameter sets the value of the StartIfOnBatteries property of scheduled jobs to True.

   -StopIfGoingOffIdle
       Suspends a running scheduled job if the computer becomes active (not idle) while the job is running.

       By default, a scheduled job that is suspended when the computer becomes active resumes when the computer 
       becomes idle again. To change this default behavior, use the RestartOnIdleResume parameter.

       The StopIfGoingOffIdle parameter sets the value of the StopIfGoingOffIdle property of scheduled jobs to True.

   -WakeToRun
       Wakes the computer from a Hibernate or Sleep state at the scheduled start time so it can run the job. By 
       default, if the computer is in a Hibernate or Sleep state at the scheduled start time, the job does not run.
 
       The WakeToRun parameter sets the value of the WakeToRun property of scheduled jobs to True.

   <a href="common.html">CommonParameters</a>:
       -Verbose, -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -WarningAction, -WarningVariable,
       -OutBuffer -PipelineVariable, -OutVariable.</pre>
<p>To change the options of a scheduled job, begin by using the Get-ScheduledJobOption cmdlet to get the job options      of a scheduled job. Then, pipe the options to Set-ScheduledJobOption or save the options in a variable and use the      InputObject parameter of Set-ScheduledJobOption cmdlet to identify the options.</p>
<p>To turn on a job option, use the parameter that sets that option. To turn off an option, type the parameter name,      a colon (:), and $false. For example, to turn off the -RunElevated option, type<span class="code"> -RunElevated:$false</span>.</p>
<p>The scheduled job options determine how the job runs when it is started by Task Scheduler. <br>
These options do not      apply when you use <a href="start-job.html">Start-Job</a>  to start a scheduled job.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Get the job options of ss64job:</p>
<pre><span class="code">PS C:\> <a href="import-module.html">Import-Module</a> TaskScheduler
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJobOption -Name ss64job</span></pre>
<p>Change the job options so the values of the WakeToRun      and RunWithoutNetwork properties are True:</p>
<pre><span class="code">PS C:\></span> Get-ScheduledJobOption -Name ss64job | Set-ScheduledJobOption -WakeToRun -RequireNetwork:$False -Passthru</pre>
<p> Changes the value of the IdleTimeout from one hour (the default) to two hours on all scheduled      jobs on the Server64:</p>
<p class="code">PS C:\&gt; Invoke-Command -Computer Server64 -ScriptBlock {Get-ScheduledJob | Get-ScheduledJobOption |      Set-ScheduledJobOption -IdleTimeout 2:00:00}</p>

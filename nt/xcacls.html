</head><body><h1>XCACLS.exe (NT 4 Resource Kit, Windows XP and 2003  - download from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/825751">Q825751</a>)</h1>
<p>Display or modify Access Control Lists (ACLs) for files and folders. For Vista and greater use <a href="icacls.html">icacls</a>.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      XCACLS <i>filename</i> [<i>options</i>]

      XCACLS <i>filename</i><br>
Key
   If no <i>options</i> are specified XCACLS will display the ACLs for the file(s)

   <i>options</i> can be any combination of:

   /T       Traverse all subfolders and change all matching files found. 
<br>   /E       Edit ACL instead of replacing it. 

   /x       Edit ACL instead of replacing it; affect only ACEs that this user already owns*

   /R <i>user</i>  Revoke all access rights from the given user.

   /D <i>user</i>  Deny specified user access, this will over-ride
            all other permissions the user has.

   /C       Continue on access denied errors. 
   /Y       Replace user's rights without verify

   /P <i>user</i>:<i>permision</i>[;<i>FolderSpec</i>]
            Replace user's rights. see /G option below

   /G <i>user</i>:<i>permision</i>[;<i>FolderSpec</i>]
           Grant specified user access rights, <i>permision</i> can be: 
           r  Read 
           c  Change (write) 
           f  Full control
           p  Change Permissions (Special access)
           o  Take Ownership (Special access)
           x  EXecute (Special access)
           e  REad (Special access)
           w  Write (Special access)
           d  Delete (Special access)
           t  Used only by <i>FolderSpec</i>. see below

<b>*</b> Option only valid in Windows 2003</pre>
<p><span class="code">FolderSpec</span> is a permission applied to a folder.  
If <span class="code">FolderSpec</span> is not specified then <span class="code">permission</span> will apply to both files and folders. <br>
This allows you to set different permissions that will apply (through inheritance) when new files are added to the folder.<br>
<br>
<span class="code">FolderSpec = ;T@</span> where @ is one of the rights above, when this is specified new files will  inherit <span class="code">FolderSpec</span> instead of <span class="code">permission</span>. At least one folder access right must follow the T For example <span class="code">;TF</span> will apply full control (but <span class="code"> ;FT</span> is not valid)<br>
<br>
Wildcards can be used to specify more that one file in a command. You can specify more than one <i>user</i> in a command. You can combine access rights.</p>
<p>Although taking ownership is listed as an option it does not work, use <a href="subinacl.html">SUBINACL</a> for this.</p>
<p><b>Inheritance Errors</b></p>
<p> &quot;<i>Permissions incorrectly ordered</i>&quot;  - the quickest way to resolve or avoid these  errors is to use the newer <a href="icacls.html">iCACLS</a> command instead of XCACLS.</p>
<p>Inherited folder permissions are displayed as:</p>
<pre> OI - Object inherit    - This folder and files. (no inheritance to subfolders)
 CI - Container inherit - This folder and subfolders.
 IO - Inherit only      - The ACE does not apply to the current file/directory

These can be combined as folllows:
 (OI)(CI)      This folder, subfolders, and files.
 (OI)(CI)(IO)  Subfolders and files only.
     (CI)(IO)  Subfolders only.
 (OI)    (IO)  Files only. </pre>
<p>So BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)F means that both files and Subdirectories will inherit 'F' (Fullcontrol) <br>
similarly (CI)R means Directories will inherit 'R' (Read folders only = List permission)</p>
<p>When xcacls is applied to the current folder only there is no inheritance and so no output.</p>
<p><b>Versions:</b><br>
NTFS standards have changed with different versions of Windows and XCACLS has been updated to suit, early versions  of Xcacls can give unpredictable results against an NTFS v5 partition.</p>
<p>  xcacls<b>.vbs</b> is described in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/?id=825751">Q825751</a> and can be <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0ad33a24-0616-473c-b103-c35bc2820bda&DisplayLang=en">downloaded here</a> -
xcacls.vbs is an unsupported utility released in 2004 that addresses a limitation with the original xcacls.exe, specifically the inability to append permissions to a folder whose child objects have the inheritance flag set. The .vbs version does not suppport unc paths and is very slow to update multiple ACLs.<br>
xcacls.vbs includes a version check function <span class="code">&quot;IsOsSupported()&quot;</span>  and so will not run under Windows 2008.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b><br>
<br>
Allow <i>guests</i> the right to read and execute in MyFolder<br>
<span class="code">XCACLS MyFolder /E /G guests:rx</span><br>
<br>
Allow <i>guests</i> the Full Control permission in MyFolder and all subfolders<br>
<span class="code">XCACLS MyFolder /T /E /G  guests:f</span><br>
<br>
Grant <i>guests</i> only read access to all files in and below MyFolder, <br>
new folders created will be Read Access only, new files will not inherit any rights.<br>
<span class="code">XCACLS MyFolder /T /P guests:R;Tr </span><br>
<br>
Grant <i>guests</i> only execute access to all files in and below MyFolder<br>
<span class="code">XCACLS MyFolder /T /P guests:x </span></p>

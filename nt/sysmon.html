<p>System Monitor - monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log.<br>
<br>
By monitoring process creation, network connections, and file changes with SysMon, you can identify malicious or anomalous activity on a network. SysMon should not be confused with <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx">Process Monitor</a>, the graphical tool for analysing running processes.</p>
<pre>Syntax
   Install:    Sysmon.exe -i [-h [sha1|md5|sha256]] [-n] [-accepteula]
   Configure:  Sysmon.exe -c [[-h [sha1|md5|sha256]] [-n]|--]
   Uninstall:  Sysmon.exe -u

Key
   -c  Update configuration of an installed Sysmon driver or dump the current
       configuration if no other argument is provided.
   -h  Specify the hash algorithm used for image identification (default is SHA1).
   -i  Install service and driver.
   -m  Install the event manifest (done on service install as well).
   -accepteula  Automatically accept the EULA on installation.
   -n  Log network connections.
   -u  Uninstall service and driver.</pre>
<p> The service logs events immediately and the driver installs as a boot-start driver to capture activity from early in the boot that the service will write to the event log when it starts. </p>
<p>On Vista and higher, events are stored in  &quot;Applications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Sysmon/Operational&quot; <br>
On older systems events write to the System event log. </p>
<p>Specify -accepteula to automatically accept the EULA on installation, otherwise you will be interactively prompted to accept it. Neither install nor uninstall require a reboot.</p>
<p> Event types generated by Sysmon:</p>
<p>Event ID 1: Process creation<br>
Event ID 2: A process changed a file creation time<br>
Event ID 3: Network connection</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Install with default settings (process images hashed with sha1 and no network monitoring):</p>
<p class="code"> sysmon –i -accepteula</p>
<p>Install with md5 hashing of process created and monitoring network connections:</p>
<p class="code">sysmon –i -accepteula –h md5 –n </p>
<p>Uninstall:</p>
<p class="code">sysmon –u </p>
<p>Dump the current configuration:</p>
<p class="code"> sysmon –c </p>
<p>Change the configuration (when Sysmon is running) to be hash sha256 and no network monitoring:</p>
<p class="code">sysmon –c –h sha256 </p>
<p>Change the configuration to default settings:</p>
<p class="code">sysmon –c --</p>

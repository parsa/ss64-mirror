<title>Parenthesis/Brackets | Windows CMD | SS64.com</title>
</head>
<body><h1>Using parenthesis/brackets to group expressions</h1>
<p>Parenthesis can be used to split commands  across multiple lines. This can make code more
  readable. Variables will be evaluated for the code block just as if the command was  a single line.</p>
<pre>
      (command)

      (
       command
       command )</pre>
<p>  Example<br>
</p>
<pre>   IF EXIST C:\pagefile.sys <b>(</b>
        ECHO pagefile found on C: drive<b>)</b></pre>
<p>  If the command will fit on a single line, then the parenthesis can be omitted e.g.<br>
    <br>
  <span class="code">IF EXIST data.xls Echo The file was  found.</span></p>
<p>vs</p>
<pre>IF EXIST data.xls <b>(</b>
   Echo The file was  found.
<b>)</b></pre>
<h2>Using variables within parenthesis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The CMD shell will  expand [read into memory] all the <a href="syntax-variables.html">variables</a> at the beginning of a code block and use those values even if the variable&rsquo;s value is  changed within the code block. 
Turning on <a href="delayedexpansion.html">DelayedExpansion</a> will force the shell to read variables at the start of every line.</p>
<p>Code blocks can be used to expand variables in places where they would not otherwise be accepted such as the &quot;tokens&quot; parameter of the <a href="for.html">FOR</a> command:</p>
<pre>@echo off
set tknz="tokens=1-2"
<b>(</b>
   for /f %tknz% %%A in ('echo') do (
     echo %%B
     echo %%A
   )
<b>)</b></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Things that break inside parenthesis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The CMD shell  does not use any great intelligence when evaluating parenthesis, so for example the command below will fail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="code"> IF EXIST MyFile.txt <b>(</b>ECHO Some(more<b>)</b>Potatoes)</p>
<p>This version will work: </p>
<p class="code">IF EXIST MyFile.txt <b>(</b>ECHO Some[more]Potatoes<b>)</b></p>
<p>You could also <a href="syntax-esc.html">escape</a> the extra parenthesis like <span class="code"><b>(</b>ECHO Some^(more^<b>)</b>Potatoes)<br>
</span>Or use quotes; though they will appear in the output <span class="code"><b>(</b>ECHO &quot;Some(more)Potatoes&quot;<b>)</b></span></p>
<p>Although parenthesis are legal in NTFS pathnames, they are often  misinterpreted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chaining to a second batch file (without using <a href="call.html">CALL</a>)  will normally exit the first batch file completely, but if you do this from a code block within parentheses then execution will return to the first batch file and continue where it left off.</p>
<p> This action appears to be very similar to just using CALL, but in some cases; particularly using 
parenthesis within the DO section of a FOR loop; the behaviour becomes buggy. A recommended coding style is to always explicitly use CALL when running a second batch file.</p>
<p> The CMD shell will read the entire content of a code block in parenthesis into memory at once. That code will  always be executed unless you break out of the block by executing a <span class="code">goto :<i>label</i></span> or <span class="code">goto :eof</span><br>
</p>
<p>A <a href="goto.html">GOTO</a> command inside a bracketed code block will break the parenthesis context and may cause errors. For example within a For-Do Loop, a GOTO command will exit the entire loop not just the current iteration.</p>
<p>The interpretation of <a href="rem.html">comments</a>/Labels within a  code block is problematic, so  put all comments outside the parenthesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Testing Numeric values </h2>
<blockquote>
<p> Do not use parenthesis or quotes if you are comparing numeric values with an <a href="if.html">IF</a> command.<br>
  For example<br>
  <span class="code">IF (2) GEQ (15) echo &quot;bigger&quot;<br>
  </span>or<span class="code"><br>
  IF &quot;2&quot; GEQ &quot;15&quot; echo &quot;bigger&quot;</span><br>
  Will perform a <b>character</b> comparison and will echo &quot;bigger&quot;</p>
<p>  however the commands:<br>
<span class="code">IF 2 GEQ 15 echo &quot;bigger&quot;</span><br>
  or
  <br>
  <span class="code">IF (2 GEQ 15) echo &quot;bigger&quot;<br>
  </span>
  Will perform a <b>numeric</b> comparison and return the correct result.</p>
<p>This behaviour is opposite to the <a href="set.html">SET</a> /a command where quotes <i>are </i>required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The maximum number of nested expressions in parenthesis is <a href="http://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=6438">256</a> (more will cause a buffer overrun).</p>

But because so much of our national income is concentrated in relatively few hands, large numbers of Americans are worse off economically than their counterparts in other advanced countries&rdquo; - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/20/magazine/for-richer.html">Paul Krugman</a></i></p>

<body><h1>DPI display settings </h1>
<p>The DPI setting of a display monitor is a measure of the number of dots that are visible in a single inch (Dots-per-Inch or Pixels-per-inch).</p>
<p>DPI is not the same as resolution. (Resolution is the number of horizontal and vertical pixels. For example, 1024 x 768 pixels.) An image with 100 x 100 pixel resolution would be 1 x 1 inch when printed at 100 DPI.</p>
<p>When a display DPI is chosen in Microsoft Windows, you are telling  the system how the attached monitor will display images,  Windows will then rescale to take this into account. </p>
<p>For example changing from 96 DPI to 120 DPI, Windows will assume that you now have a display with closely packed (dense) pixels that  make everything 20% smaller, so to compensate  will scale everything to be   25% larger.</p>
<p>The changes made by adjusting DPI are more subtle than changing screen resolution, but setting DPI correctly can be important for preventing eye strain when using high pixel density displays.</p>
<p>The ideal* DPI for a display can be calculated using <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/pythagoras.html">pythagoras</a> as follows:</p>
<p>Given:<br>
W = Width in Pixels<br>H = Height in Pixels<br>S = Diagonal Size in Inches (display size) 
<p>Then the DPI = <span class="code">√(W<sup>2</sup> + H<sup>2</sup>) / S<br>
</span>examples <br>
An iPad with a 9.7&quot; screen <span class="code">√(1024<sup>2</sup> + 768<sup>2</sup>) / 9.7= 132</span> DPI<br>
An IBM Thinkpad with a 15&quot; screen <span class="code">√(1920<sup>2</sup> + 1200<sup>2</sup>) / 15.4= 147</span> DPI</p>
<p>* In practice you should select DPI based on individuals eyesight/preference.<br>
It is not advisable to set a DPI lower than 96 as the majority of Windows fonts are not hinted to display correctly at very small sizes.</p>
<h2> Windows 7/2008 DPI settings:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>96 to 500 DPI <br>
<span class="code">Control Panel | Display | Set Custom Text Size (DPI)<br>
or
<br>
Control Panel | Personalisation | Adjust Font Size (DPI)<br>
<br>
</span>For custom sizes, tick: “<span class="code">Use Windows XP style DPI Scaling</span>”  un-ticking this option will turn on full scaling of all non-DPI aware applications, which can cause fonts to become blurry.</p>
<p>When  Windows SETUP is run to install Windows, the DPI will be set according to the capabilities of the attached monitor.<br>
This will automatically set most high resolution monitors to 120 DPI.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Citrix and Terminal servers</h2>
<p>Setting the DPI for individual users connected to a terminal server (or Citrix) can only be done in the registry, if the DPI is changed in the  Control Panel as above, then the change will apply to all users.

<title>con2prt - Add or Remove Printer Connections | Windows CMD | SS64.com</title>
</head><body><h1>CON2PRT.exe (Zero Admin Toolkit, discontinued)</h1> 
<p> Connect or disconnect a Printer<br>
  <br>
  All commands issued using this utility will affect only the user currently
  logged in. Con2prt is therefore ideal for managing NETWORK printer connections
  when
  used in a login script.</p>
<pre>Syntax 
      CON2PRT /f
      CON2PRT /c \\PrintServer\PrintShare
      CON2PRT /cd \\PrintServer\PrintShare

Key
       /f  - remove all network printer connections
       /c  - connect to \\PrintServer\PrintShare
       /cd - connect to and set PrintShare as the default printer       </pre>
<p> Several switches can be combined in one command line. So you 
  can remove all connections before adding new ones all in one command, you can 
only specify one default printer.</p>
<p>Microsoft now recommend the more flexible <span class="body"><a href="rundll32.html">RUNDLL32</a></span> in preference to con2prt.</p>
<p>The freeware utility <a href="adprintx.zip">AdPrintX</a> is
  very similar to Con2Prt but has additional functionality, including compatibility
with Windows 9x systems. </p>

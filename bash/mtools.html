</head><body><h1>mtools</h1> 
<p>Mtools is a public domain collection of tools to allow Unix systems to manipulate MS-DOS files: read, write, and move around files on an MS-DOS 
filesystem <br><br>Mtools are typically used to manipulate FAT formatted floppy disks. Each program attempts to emulate the MS-DOS equivalent command.<br>
<br>Mtools is sufficient to give access to MS-DOS filesystems. For instance, commands such as <span class="code">mdir a:</span> work on the <span class="code">a:</span> floppy without any preliminary mounting or 
initialization (assuming the default `/etc/mtools.conf' works on your machine). With mtools, one can change floppies  without unmounting and mounting.</p>
<pre>MTOOLS Programs

floppyd           floppy daemon to run on your X server box
floppyd_installtest small utility to check for the presence of floppyd
mattrib           change MS-DOS file attribute flags
<a href="mbadblocks.html">mbadblocks</a>        tests a floppy disk, and marks the bad blocks in the FAT
mcat              same as cat. Only useful with floppyd.

mdu               list space occupied by directory and its contents
mformat           add an MS-DOS filesystem to a low-level formatted floppy disk
minfo             get information about an MS-DOS filesystem.
mlabel            make an MS-DOS volume label
mkmanifest        makes a list of short name equivalents

mmount            mount an MS-DOS disk
mpartition        create an MS-DOS as a partition
mrd               remove an MS-DOS subdirectory
mmove             move or rename an MS-DOS file or subdirectory
mren              rename an existing MS-DOS file
mshowfat          shows the FAT map of a file
mtoolstest        tests and displays the configuration
mtype             display contents of an MS-DOS file
mzip              zip disk specific commands
xcopy             recursively copy a dos directory into another</pre>

<p><b>Equivalent Windows commands:</b><br>
<br>In the same way that mtools are DOS/Windows commands ported to run under UNIX, most UNIX commands have been ported to run under Windows.<br>
A limited selection of POSIX tools were included in the Windows NT resource kits, more can be found on the net.</p></body>

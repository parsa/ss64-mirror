</head><body><h1>fmt</h1> 
<p>Reformat paragraph text, fill and join lines to produce output 
  lines of a given width (75 characters by default).<br>
</p>
<pre>Syntax
     fmt [<i>option(s)</i>]... [<i>file</i>]...

Options

   -c
   --crown-margin
       "Crown margin" mode: preserve the indentation of the first two
       lines within a paragraph, and align the left margin of each
       subsequent line with that of the second line.

   -t
   --tagged-paragraph
       "Tagged paragraph" mode: like crown margin mode, except that if indentation
       of the first line of a paragraph is the same as the indentation of the
       second, the first line is treated as a one-line paragraph.

   -s
   --split-only
       Split lines only.  Do not join short lines to form longer ones.
       This prevents sample lines of code, and other such "formatted" text from
       being unduly combined.

   -u
   --uniform-spacing
       Uniform spacing.  Reduce spacing between words to one space, and spacing 
       between sentences to two spaces.

   -<i>WIDTH</i>
   -w <i>WIDTH</i>
   --width=<i>WIDTH</i>
       Fill output lines up to WIDTH characters (default 75).  `fmt' initially tries to 
       make lines about 7% shorter than this, to give it room to balance line lengths. 

   -p <i>PREFIX</i>
   --prefix=<i>PREFIX</i>
       Only lines beginning with PREFIX (possibly preceded by whitespace) are subject
       to formatting. The prefix and any preceding whitespace are stripped for the
       formatting and then re-attached to each formatted output line.
       One use is to format certain kinds of program comments, while leaving the code unchanged.</pre>
<p><b>Notes<br>
  </b>`fmt' reads from the specified FILE arguments (or standard input if none 
  are given), and writes to standard output.</p>
<p>The fmt utility is meant to format mail messages prior to sending, 
  but can also be useful for other simple tasks. </p>
<p>By default, blank lines, spaces between words, and indentation are preserved in the output; successive input lines with different indentation 
  are not joined; tabs are expanded on input and introduced on output. </p>
<p>`fmt' prefers breaking lines at the end of a sentence, and tries to avoid line breaks after the first word of a sentence or before the last word 
  of a sentence. A "sentence break" is defined as either the end of a paragraph or a word ending in any of `.?!', followed by two spaces or end of line, ignoring 
  any intervening parentheses or quotes.</p>

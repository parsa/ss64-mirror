</head><h1>Command substitution</h1>
<p> Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command 
  itself. <br>
  <br>
  Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed as follows:</p>
<pre>$(command) 
or 
`command`</pre>
<p>Bash performs the expansion by executing command and replacing the command 
  substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines 
  deleted. </p>
<p>  Embedded newlines are not deleted, but they can be removed during word splitting. 
  <br>
The command substitution <span class="code">$(cat file)</span> can be replaced by the equivalent but faster 
  <span class="code">$(< file)</span>. <br>
  <br>
  When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used, backslash retains 
  its literal meaning except when followed by `$', ``', or `\'. The first backquote 
  not preceded by a backslash terminates the command substitution. When using 
  the $(command) form, all characters between the parentheses make up the command; 
  none are treated specially. <br>
  <br>
  Command substitutions can be nested. To nest when using the backquoted form, 
  escape the inner backquotes with backslashes. <br>
  <br>
  If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and filename 
expansion are not performed on the results.</p>
<h2>Process substitution operators:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> <span class="code">&nbsp;&lt;(<i>command</i>) </span></p>
<p> <span class="code"> &nbsp;&gt;(<i>command</i>) </span></p>
<p><i>command</i>  can be any command that produces output on stdout. Bash execs the command, creates a named pipe from the output, and replaces the operator with the name of that pipe. You can then read stdout from that pipe as you would from a regular file. When execution is finished,  the named pipe is removed automatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Diff the output of two processes:</p>
<p class="code">$ diff &lt;(/sbin/lsmod) &lt;(ssh sys1 /sbin/lsmod)</p>
<p>To do this without using   process substitution would require using a temporary file.</p>
<p>Merge and sort a selection of files:</p>
<pre>$ sort -m &lt;(zcat file.1.gz) &lt;(zcat file.2.gz) &lt;(zcat file.3.gz) ... | gzip -c &gt; merged.gz</pre>

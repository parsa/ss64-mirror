 TAB        Tab completion for file/directory names</pre>
<blockquote><p>For example, to move to a directory 'sample1'; Type<span class="code"> cd sam</span> ;  then press <span class="code">TAB</span> and <span class="code">ENTER</span>. <br>
type just enough characters to uniquely identify the directory you wish to open.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Special keys: Tab, Backspace, Enter, Esc</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Text Terminals send characters (bytes), not key strokes. <br>
Special keys such as Tab, Backspace, Enter and Esc are  encoded as control characters. <br>
Control characters are not printable, they display in the terminal as <span class="code">^</span> and are intended to have an effect on applications.<br>
<span class="code"><br>
Ctrl+I = Tab<br>
Ctrl+J = Newline<br>
Ctrl+M = Enter</span><span class="code"><br>
Ctrl+[ = Escape</span></p>
<p>Many terminals will also send control characters for  keys in the digit row: <br>
<span class="code">Ctrl+2 → ^@<br>
Ctrl+3 → ^[ </span>Escape<span class="code"><br>
Ctrl+4 → ^\<br>
Ctrl+5 → ^]<br>
Ctrl+6 → ^^<br>
Ctrl+7 → ^_ </span>Undo<span class="code"><br>
Ctrl+8 → ^? </span>Backward-delete-char</p>
<p><span class="code">Ctrl+v</span> tells the terminal to not interpret the following character, so <span class="code">Ctrl+v Ctrl-I</span> will display a tab character, <br>
similarly <span class="code">Ctrl+v ENTER</span> will display the escape sequence for the Enter key: <span class="code">^M</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>History:</h2>
<pre>  Ctrl + r   Recall the last command including the specified character(s)
             searches the command history as you type.
             Equivalent to : vim ~/.bash_history. 
  Ctrl + p   Previous command in history (i.e. walk back through the command history)
  Ctrl + n   Next command in history (i.e. walk forward through the command history)

  Ctrl + s   Go back to the next most recent command.
             (beware to not execute it from a terminal because this will also launch its XOFF).
  Ctrl + o   Execute the command found via Ctrl+r or Ctrl+s
  Ctrl + g   Escape from history searching mode
        !!   Repeat last command
      !<i>abc</i>   Run last command starting with <i>abc</i><br>    !<i>abc</i>:p   Print last command starting with <i>abc</i><br>        !$   Last argument of previous command<br>   ALT + .   Last argument of previous command<br>        !*   All arguments of previous command<br>^<i>abc</i>­^­<i>def</i>   Run previous command, replacing <i>abc</i> with <i>def</i></pre>
<h2>Process control:</h2>
<pre> Ctrl + C   Interrupt/Kill whatever you are running (SIGINT)
 Ctrl + l   Clear the screen
 Ctrl + s   Stop output to the screen (for long running verbose commands)
            Then use PgUp/PgDn for navigation
 Ctrl + q   Allow output to the screen (if previously stopped using command above)
 Ctrl + D   Send an EOF marker, unless disabled by an option, this will close the current shell (EXIT)
 Ctrl + Z   Send the signal SIGTSTP to the current task, which suspends it.
            To return to it later enter <a href="fg.html">fg</a> 'process name' (foreground).</pre>
<h2>Emacs mode vs Vi Mode</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>All the above assume that bash is running in the default Emacs setting, if you prefer this can be switched to <a href="../vi.html">Vi</a> shortcuts instead. </p>
<p>Set Vi Mode in bash:</p>
<pre>$ set -o vi </pre>
<p>Set Emacs Mode in bash:</p>
<pre>$ set -o emacs </pre>

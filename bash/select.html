</head><body><h1>select</h1> 
<p>The <code>select</code> construct allows the easy generation of 
  menus. It has almost the same syntax as the <code>for</code> command.</p>

<pre>Syntax
      select <var>name</var> [in <var>words</var> ...]; do <var>commands</var>; done</pre>
<p>The list of words following <code>in</code> is expanded, generating a list 
  of items. The set of expanded words is printed on the standard error output 
  stream, each preceded by a number.<br>
  <br>
  If the <samp>`in <var>words</var>'</samp> is omitted, the positional parameters 
  are printed, as if <samp>`in "$@"'</samp> had been specifed. The <code>PS3</code> 
  prompt is then displayed and a line is read from the standard input. If the 
  line consists of a number corresponding to one of the displayed words, then 
  the value of <var>name</var> is set to that word. If the line is empty, the 
  words and prompt are displayed again. If <code>EOF</code> is read, the <code>select</code> 
  command completes. Any other value read causes <var>name</var> to be set to 
  null. The line read is saved in the variable <code>REPLY</code>.<br>
  <br>
  The <var>commands</var> are executed after each selection until a <code>break</code> 
  or <code>return</code> command is executed, at which point the <code>select</code> 
  command completes. <br>
  <br>
  Here is an example that allows the user to pick a filename from the current 
  directory, and displays the name and index of the file selected. </p>
<pre>select fname in *;
do
   echo you picked $fname \($REPLY\)
   break;
done
</pre>
<p><code>((...))</code> </p>
<pre>(( <var>expression</var> ))
</pre>
<p> If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise 
  the return status is 1. This is exactly equivalent to </p>
<pre>let "<var>expression</var>"</pre>

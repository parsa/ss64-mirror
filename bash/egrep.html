<p>Search file(s) for lines that match an extended expression (extended grep) </p>
<pre>Syntax
      egrep [ <i>options</i> ] '<i>PATTERN</i>' <i>files</i> ...

egrep is the same as `grep <a href="grep-regex.html">-E</a>'

all other <i>options</i> are the same as <a href="grep.html">grep</a> 
</pre>
<p> The <i>PATTERN</i> is a regexp.  In typical usage, the regexp is quoted to
prevent the shell from expanding any of the special characters as file
name wildcards.  Normally, `egrep' prints the lines that matched.<br>
If
multiple file names are provided on the command line, each output line
is preceded by the name of the file and a colon.<br>
</p>
<pre>
OPTIONS

  -c
     Print out a count of the lines that matched the pattern, instead
     of the lines themselves.

  -s
     Be silent. No output is produced, and the exit value indicates
     whether or not the pattern was matched.

  -v
     Invert the sense of the test. `egrep' prints the lines that do
     *not* match the pattern, and exits successfully if the pattern was
     not matched.

  -i
     Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the input data.

  -l
     Only print the names of the files that matched, not the lines that
     matched.

  -e <i>PATTERN</i>
     Use PATTERN as the regexp to match.  The purpose of the `-e'
     option is to allow patterns that start with a `-'.</pre>

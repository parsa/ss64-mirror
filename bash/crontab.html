</head><body><h1>crontab (cron table)</h1> 
<p>Schedule a command to run at a later time.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      crontab [ -u <i>user</i> ] <i>file</i>

      crontab [ -u <i>user</i> ] { -l | -r | -e }

Key
   -l  List - display the current crontab entries.

   -r  Remove the current crontab.

   -e  Edit the current crontab using the editor specified by the 
       VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.
       After you exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed automatically.</pre>
<p>  <span class="body">Crontab is the program used to install, deinstall or  list
  the tables used to drive the <a href="cron.html">cron</a> daemon in Vixie Cron.<br>
  Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are
  files  in  /var,  they  are  not  intended  to  be  edited
  directly.<br>
  <br>

  If  the  -u  option is given, it specifies the name of the
  user whose crontab is to be tweaked.  If  this  option  is 
  not  given,  crontab  examines "your" crontab, i.e., the       
  crontab of the person executing the  command.   Note  that <a href="su.html">su</a> can  confuse  crontab  and  that if you are running
  inside of <a href="su.html">su</a> you should always use the  -u  option  for
  safety's sake.</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="code">cron <i>file</i> </span>is used to install a new
  crontab from some named file  or  standard  input  if  the
pseudo-filename<span class="code"> - </span>is given.</p>
<p>A crontab file contains instructions to the <a href="cron.html">cron</a> daemon of the general
form: `run this command at this time on this date'.  Each user has
their own crontab, and commands in any given crontab will be executed as
the user who owns the crontab.  Uucp and News will usually have their own
crontabs, eliminating the need for explicitly running <a href="su.html">su</a> as part of a
cron command.</p>
<h2>Crontab comments and variables</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored.  Lines whose first
non-space character is a pound-sign (#) are comments, and are ignored.<br>
Comments are not allowed on the same line as cron commands,
since they will be taken to be part of the command.  Similarly, comments
are not allowed on the same line as environment variable settings.<br>
<br>
An active line in a crontab will be either an environment setting or a
cron command. </p>
<p>An environment setting is of the form, <span class="code">name = value</span> where the spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any subsequent non-leading spaces in value will be part of the value assigned to
name.  The value string can be placed in quotes (single or double, but
matching) to preserve leading or trailing blanks.	The name string can 
also be placed in quote (single or double, but matching) to preserve
leading, traling or inner blanks.<br>
<br>
Several environment variables are set up automatically by the <a href="cron.html">cron</a> daemon.  SHELL is set to <span class="code">/bin/sh</span>, and LOGNAME and HOME are set from the
<span class="code">/etc/passwd</span> line of the crontab's owner.  HOME and SHELL can be overridden by settings in the crontab; LOGNAME can not.<br>
<br>
(Another note: the LOGNAME variable is sometimes called USER on BSD systems...  on these systems, USER will be set also).<br>
<br>
In addition to LOGNAME, HOME, and SHELL, <a href="cron.html">cron</a> will look at MAILTO if
it has any reason to send mail as a result of running commands in `this' crontab. If MAILTO is defined (and non-empty), mail is sent to the user so named. If MAILTO is defined but empty (MAILTO=""), no mail will be sent.  Otherwise mail is sent to the owner of the crontab. This option is useful if you decide on /bin/mail instead of /usr/lib/sendmail
as your mailer when you install cron -- /bin/mail doesn't do aliasing,
and UUCP usually doesn't read its mail.</p>
<p>The CRON_TZ specifies the time zone specific for the cron table. User type into the chosen table times in the time of the specified time zone. The time into log is taken from local time zone, where is the daemon running. The MLS_LEVEL environment variable provides support for multiple per-job SELinux security contexts in the same crontab. By default, cron jobs execute with the default SELinux security context of the user that created the crontab file. When using multiple security levels and roles, this may not be sufficient, because the same user may be running in a different role or at a different security level. For more about roles and SELinux MLS/MCS see selinux(8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commands are executed by <a href="cron.html">cron</a> when the minute, hour,
and month of year fields match the current time, and when at least one of
the two day fields (day of month, or day of week) match the current time. <a href="cron.html">cron</a> examines cron entries once every minute.</p>
<h2>Crontab format</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> The format of a cron command is very much the V7 standard, with a number
of upward-compatible extensions. </p>
<p>Each line has <b>five</b> time and date
fields, followed by a <b>user name</b> (with optional `:<i>group</i>' and
`/<i>login-class</i>' suffixes) if this is the system crontab file, followed
by a <b>command</b>.  You should run the task as a user with only the privileges it needs to run, and nothing else. For example, if you need to backup a database, don't just use the database root user, but use (or create) a specific user with only the rights needed to perform the backup.</p>
<p>You should test each command interactively on the command line, logged in as the user configured to run the task and with the appropriate environment set.</p>
<p>Each line in the cron table follows the following format:</p>
<pre>* * * * *  [<i>UserName</i>] <i>Command_to_execute</i>
- – – – -
| | | | |
| | | | +—– Day of week (0–7) (Sunday=0 or 7) or Sun, Mon, Tue,&hellip;
| | | +———- Month (1–12) or Jan, Feb,&hellip;
| | +————-— Day of month (1–31)
| +——————– Hour (0–23)
+————————- Minute (0–59)</pre>
<p>There are several ways of specifying multiple values in a field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8226; The asterisk (<span class="code">*</span>) operator specifies all possible values for a field. e.g. every hour or every day (first-last).<br>
&#8226; The comma (<span class="code">,</span>) operator specifies a list of values, for example: &quot;1,3,4,7,8&quot; The specified range is inclusive.<br>
&#8226; The dash (<span class="code">-</span>) operator specifies a range of values, for example: &quot;1-6&quot;, which is equivalent to &quot;1,2,3,4,5,6&quot;<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also an operator which some extended versions of cron support, the slash (<span class="code">/</span>) operator, which can be used to skip a given number of values. For example, &quot;<span class="code">*/3</span>&quot; in the hour time field is equivalent to &quot;0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21&quot;; <br>
&quot;<span class="code">*</span>&quot; specifies 'every hour' but the &quot;<span class="code">/3</span>&quot; means that only the first, fourth, seventh...and such values given by &quot;<span class="code">*</span>&quot; are used.</p>
<p>Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a range
with `/<i>number</i>' specifies skips of the number's value through the
range.  For example, <span class="code">0-23/2</span> can be used in the hours field to specify
command execution every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard is
<span class="code">0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22</span>).  <br>
Steps are also permitted after an
asterisk, so if you want to say `every two hours', just use <span class="code">*/2</span><br>
<br>
Names can also be used for the 'month' and 'day of week' fields.  Use
the first three letters of the particular day or month (case doesn't matter).  Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.<br>
<br>
The 'sixth' field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be
run.  The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or % character, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell specified in the SHELL
variable of the cronfile. Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will be sent to the command as standard input.</p>
<p>Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings can appear:<br>
</p>
<pre>
      string        meaning
      ------        -------
      @reboot      Run once, at startup.
      @yearly      Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".
      @annually     (sames as @yearly)
      @monthly      Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *".
      @weekly      Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".
      @daily        Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".
      @midnight     (same as @daily)
      @hourly      Run once an hour, "0 * * * *".</pre></blockquote>
<h2>The Command to be executed</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If the command to be executed is at all complex,   place it into its own script and just add that script to the crontab file.</p>
<p>The crontab files have to be regular files or symlinks to regular files, they must not be executable or writable by anyone else other than the owner. This requirement can be overridden by specifying <span class="code"><a href="cron.html">cron</a> -p</span> on the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Logging progress</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Cron will email to  the <span class="code">user</span> all output of the commands it runs, although it is possible to silence this, by redirecting the output to  <span class="code">/dev/null</span>, a better approach is redirecting to a log file so that you capture any errors.</p>
<p>If you do want to log process via mail; and have a  mail agent configured; then set the destination address in a MAILTO variable at the top of the crontab file: </p>
<p class="code">MAILTO=ashley.gray@example.com</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Files </h2>
<blockquote>
<p> If inotify support is in use, changes in the symlinked crontabs are not automatically noticed by the cron daemon. The cron daemon must receive a SIGHUP to reload the crontabs. This is a limitation of inotify API.</p>
<p>If the <span class="code">/etc/cron.allow</span> file exists, then users must be listed in it in order to be allowed to run the crontab command.<br>
If the <span class="code">/etc/cron.allow</span> file does not exist but the <span class="code">/etc/cron.deny</span> file does, then users must not be listed in the <span class="code">/etc/cron.deny</span> file in order to run crontab. </p>
<p> crontab updates the modtime of the spool directory whenever it changes a crontab.</p>
<p><span class="code">/etc/anacrontab</span> System crontab file for jobs like cron.daily, weekly, monthly.<br>
<span class="code">/var/spool/cron/</span> Usual place for storing users crontab. <br>
<span class="code">/etc/cron.d/</span> Stored system crontables, grouped in separate files. </p>

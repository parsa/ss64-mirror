Interactive commands:

   Arrows, PgUP, PgDn, Home, End
               Scroll the process list. 
   Space       Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes,
               like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes, instead of
               the currently highlighted one. 
   U           Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key).
   s           Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing this key will
               attach it to the currently selected process, presenting a live update of system
               calls issued by the process.
   l           Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed, pressing this key
               will display the list of file descriptors opened by the process.
   F1, h, ?    Go to the help screen 
   F2, S       Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed at the top of the screen,
               set various display options, choose among color schemes, and select
               which columns are displayed, in which order. 
   F3, /       Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed processes.
               The currently selected (highlighted) command will update as you type.
               While in search mode, pressing F3 will cycle through matching occurrences. 
   F4, \       Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line and only
               processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel filtering, enter the
               Filter option again and press Esc. 
   F5, t       Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the relations between them as a tree.
               Toggling the key will switch between tree and your previously selected sort view.
               Selecting a sort view will exit tree view. 
   F6, <, >    Select a field for sorting. The current sort field is indicated by a highlight in the header. 
   F7, ]       Increase the selected process's priority (subtract from 'nice' value).
               This can only be done by the superuser. 
   F8, [       Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value) 
   F9, k       "Kill" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one or a group of processes.
               If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all tagged processes.
               If none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process. 
   F10, q      Quit 
   I           Invert the sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing, and vice-versa.
   +, -        When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree.
               When a subtree is collapsed a "+" sign shows to the left of the process name.
   a (on multiprocessor machines)
               Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use. 
   u           Show only processes owned by a specified user.
   M           Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).
   P           Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).
   T           Sort by time (top compatibility key).
   F           "Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process to
               move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for monitoring
               a process: this way, you can keep a process always visible on screen.
               When a movement key is used, "follow" loses effect.
   K           Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to be displayed
               in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
   H           Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than ordinary
               processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from userspace
               processes in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
   Ctrl-L      Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values. 
   Numbers     PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be moved to it. </pre>
<h2>Columns</h2>
<p>The following columns can display data about each process. A value of '-' in all the rows indicates that a column is unsupported on your system, or currently unimplemented in htop. The names below are the ones used in the &quot;Available Columns&quot; section of the setup screen. If a different name is shown in htop's main screen, it is shown below in parenthesis.</p>
<pre>
Command    The full command line of the process (i.e program name and arguments). 
PID        The process ID.
PPID       The parent process ID.

                  on the CPU in user mode (i.e everything but system calls), measured in clock ticks. 
STIME (STIME+)    The system CPU time, which is the amount of time the kernel has spent executing
                  system calls on behalf of the process, measured in clock ticks.

                  time (see UTIME, STIME above). 
CUTIME            The children's user CPU time, which is the amount of time the process's waited-for
                  children have spent executing in user mode (see UTIME above). 
CSTIME            The children's system CPU time, which is the amount of time the kernel has
                  spent executing system calls on behalf of all the process's waited-for children
                  (see STIME above). 
PRIORITY (PRI)    The kernels internal priority for the process, usually just it's nice value plus
                  twenty. Different for real-time processes. 
PERCENT_MEM       The percentage of memory the process is currently using (based on the process's

<p>htop displays per-process CPU usage (not  total server load)  it is  useful for seeing how much work the machine is doing now compared to some point in the past.</p>
<p><b>Example <br></b><br>
To display processes sorted by USER, updating every 5 seconds:<br>
<span class="code">$ htop -s USER --delay=50</span></p>

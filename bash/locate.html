</head><body><h1>locate</h1> 
<p>Find files. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      locate [<i>options</i>]<i> pattern</i>

Options

   -d path, --database=path
                Search databases in path.
                path must be a colon- separated list.

   -h, --help   Print a help message and exit.

   --version    Print version information and then exit.</pre>
<p>Search database(s) of filenames and print matches. *, ?, [, and ] are treated specially; / and . are not. </p>
<p>Matches include all files that contain pattern, unless pattern includes metacharacters, in which case locate requires an exact match.</p>
<p>If locate does not work, run the command: <a href="slocate.html">slocate -u</a> to rebuild the index.</p>
<h2>Faster Searches</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>On modern hardware it is often faster to create and search an uncompressed index file of all filenames than to use the compressed locate database, source: Julia Evans [<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/03/05/how-the-locate-command-works-and-lets-rewrite-it-in-one-minute/">x</a>]</p>
<p class="code">sudo find / &gt; database.txt<br>
grep Alanis database.txt</p>

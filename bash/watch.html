</head><body><h1>watch</h1> 
<p>Execute a program periodically, showing output full screen</p>
<pre>Syntax
      watch [<i>options</i>] <i>command</i> <i>options</i>

Options

   -<i>n</i>
   --interval=<i>n</i> 
                 Specify an interval <i>n</i> seconds to run <i>command</i>

   -d
   --differences[=cumulative]]
                 Highlight the differences between successive updates

   -h
   --help        Display Help

   -v
   --version     Display version</pre>
<p> watch  runs command repeatedly, displaying its output (the first screenfull).  This allows you to watch  the  program<br>
output  change  over time. By default, the program is run every 2 seconds.<br>
<br>
The <span class="code">--cumulative</span> option makes highlighting "sticky", presenting a running display of all positions that have ever changed.<br>
<br>
watch will run until interrupted.<br>
<br>
Note that <i>command</i> is given to "sh -c" which means that you might need to use extra quoting to get the desired effect.<br>
<br>
POSIX  option processing is used (i.e., option processing stops at the first non-option argument). This means  that  <i>command_options</i> don't get interpreted by watch itself.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<pre>       To watch for mail, you might do

              watch -n 60 from

       To watch the contents of a directory change, you could use

              watch -d ls -l

       If  you're only interested in files owned by user joe, you
       might use

              watch -d 'ls -l | fgrep joe'

       To see the effects of quoting, try these out

              watch echo $$

              watch echo '$$'

              watch echo "'"'$$'"'"

       You can watch for your administrator to install the latest
       kernel with

              watch uname -r

       (Just kidding.)
</pre>
<p>  Bugs<br>
  Upon  terminal  resize,  the  screen will not be correctly
  repainted until the next scheduled update.  All differences highlighting is lost on that update as well.<br>
  Non-printing  characters are stripped from program output.       
  Use "cat -v" as part of the command pipeline if  you  want       
  to see them.</p>

<p>Open a file or folder.<br>
The open command opens a file (or a folder or URL), just as if you had double-clicked the file's icon. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      open [<i>options</i>] [-b <i>bundle_identifier</i>] [-a <i>application</i>] file ...
         [--args <i>arg1 </i>...]

Key
   -a <i>application</i>
         The application to use for opening the file

   -b <i>bundle_indentifier</i>
         The bundle identifier for the application to use when opening the file.

   -D    Reveal the enclosing folder in finder. 

   -e    Open the file with /Applications/TextEdit

   -t    Open the file with the default text editor, as determined via Launch-Services

   -f    Read input from standard input and open the results in the default text editor.
         End input by sending EOF character (type Control-D).  Also useful for piping output
         to open and having it open in the default text editor.

   -F    Open the application "fresh," that is, without restoring windows. Saved persistent
         state is lost, except for Untitled documents.

   -W    Wait until the applications exit (even if they were already open).
         Use with the -n flag to allow open to function as an appropriate app for the
         $EDITOR environment variable.

   -R    Reveal the file(s) in the Finder instead of opening them.

   -n    Open a new instance of the application(s) even if one is already running.

   -g    Do not bring the application to the foreground.

   -h    Search header locations for a header whose name matches the given string and then
         open it.  Pass a full header name (such as NSView.h) for increased performance.

   --args
         All remaining arguments are passed to the opened application in the argv parameter to
         main().  These arguments are not opened or interpreted by the open tool.</pre>
<p> If no application name is specified, the default application as determined via LaunchServices is used to open the specified files.<br>
You can specify one or more file names (or pathnames), which are interpreted relative to the shell or Terminal window's current working directory. e.g. open *.doc</P>

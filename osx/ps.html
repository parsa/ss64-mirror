<p>Process status, information about processes running in memory.</p>
<pre>Syntax

         ps [-aCcefhjlMmrSTuvwx] [-O <i>fmt</i>] [-o <i>fmt</i>] [-p <i>pid</i>] [-t <i>tty</i>] [-U <i>username</i>]

         ps [-L]

Options
     -a    Display information about other users' processes as well as your own.

     -c    Change the `command' column output to just contain the executable name
           rather than the full command line.

     -C    Change the way the cpu percentage is calculated by using a
           'raw' cpu calculation that ignores `resident' time (this normally has no effect).       

     -e    Display the environment as well.
 
     -f    Show commandline and environment information about swapped out processes.
           This option is honored only if the uid of the user is  0.

     -h    Repeat the information header as often as necessary to guarantee
           one header per page of information.

     -j    Print information associated with the following keywords: user,
           pid, ppid, pgid, sess, jobc, state, tt, time and command.

     -L    List the set of available <a href="ps_keywords.html">keywords</a>.

     -l    Display information associated with the following keywords: uid,
           pid, ppid, cpu, pri, nice, vsz, rss, wchan, state, tt, time and command.

     -M    Print the threads corresponding to each task.

     -m    Sort by memory usage, instead of by process ID.

     -O    Add the information associated with the space or comma separated
           list of <a href="ps_keywords.html">keywords</a> specified, after the <b>process ID</b>, in the default
           information display.  Keywords can  be appended with an equals
           (`=') sign and a string.   This causes the printed header to use
           the specified string instead of the standard header.

     -o    Display information associated with the space or comma separated
           list of <a href="ps_keywords.html">keywords</a> specified.  Keywords can  be appended with an
           equals (`=') sign and a string.  This causes the printed header
           to use the specified string instead of the standard header.

     -p    Display information associated with the specified process ID.

     -r    Sort by current cpu usage, instead of by process ID.

     -S    Change the way the process time is calculated by summing all
           exited children to their parent process.

     -T    Display information about processes attached to the device asso-
           ciated with the standard input.

     -t    Display information about processes attached to the specified
           terminal device.

     -U    Display the processes belonging to the specified username.

     -u    Display information associated with the following keywords: user,
           pid, %cpu, %mem, vsz, rss, tt, state, start, time and command.
           The -u option implies the -r option.

     -v    Display information associated with the following keywords: pid,
           state, time, sl, re, pagein, vsz, rss, lim, tsiz, %cpu, %mem and
           command.  The -v option implies the -m option.

     -w    Use 132 columns to display information, instead of the default
           which is your window size.   If the -w option is specified more
           than once, ps will use as many columns as necessary without
           regard for your window size.

     -x    Display information about processes without controlling terminals.</pre>
<p>Since ps cannot run faster than the system and is run as any other 
  scheduled process, the information it displays can never be exact.</p>

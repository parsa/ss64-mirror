<p>Display and manipulate extended attributes of one      or more files, including directories and symbolic links.</p>
<pre>Syntax
   List attributes
      xattr [-lrsvx] <i>file</i> ...

   Print the value associated with the given attribute:
      xattr -p [-lrsvx] <i>attr_name file</i> ...

   Write a given attribute name with a value:
      xattr -w [-rsx] <i>attr_name attr_value file</i> ...

   Delete the given attribute from <i>file</i>:
      xattr -d [-rsv] <i>attr_name file</i> ...

   Clear all attributes including their associated values:
      xattr -c [-rsv] <i>file</i> ...

   Display help:
      xattr -h | --help

Key
   -l  By default, the first two command forms either display just the attribute names or
       values, respectively. The -l option causes both the attribute names and corresponding
       values to be displayed. For hex display of values, the output is preceeded with the hex
       offset values and followed by ASCII display, enclosed by '|'.

   -r  If a file argument is a directory, act as if the entire contents of the directory
       recursively were also specified (so that every file in the directory tree is acted upon).

   -s  If a file argument is a symbolic link, act on the symbolic link itself, rather than
       the file that the symbolic link points at.

   -v  Force the the file name to be displayed, even for a single file.

   -x  Force the attribute value to be displayed in the hexadecimal representation.       </pre>
<p>Extended attributes are arbitrary metadata stored with a file, but separate from the filesystem attributes (such as      modification time or file size).  The metadata is often a null-terminated UTF-8 string,      but can also be arbitrary binary data.<br>
One or more files may be specified on the command line.</p>
<p> In OS X, extended attributes are most often seen in the <b>'iPhoto Library'</b> and <b>'Photo Booth Library'</b> - these are folders with a bundle bit applied so that they appear in the Apple Finder as a single file, this is done to hide the files so that they can be managed by a single application.</p>
<p>For the first two forms of the      command, if there is more than one file, the file name is displayed along with the      actual results.  When only one file is specified, the display of the file name is       suppressed unless the -v option, is also specified.</p>
<p>In the first form of the command ( <span class="code">-w</span> with no other mode option specified), the names of <b>all</b> extended attributes are listed. </p>
<p>In the second form,  the <span class="code">-p</span> option (print), the value associated with the given attribute name      is displayed.  </p>
<p>Attribute values are usually displayed as strings.  However, if nils are detected in the      data, the value is displayed in a hexadecimal representation.</p>
<p>The <span class="code">-w</span> option normally assumes the input attribute value is a string.  Specifying the -x option
         causes xattr to expect the input in hexadecimal (whitespace is ignored).  The <a href="xxd.html">xxd</a> command can be
used to create hexadecimal representations from exising binary data, to pass to xattr.</p>
<p> As an alternative to <span class="code">xattr -w</span> attribute names can also be displayed using <span class="code"><a href="ls.html">ls</a> -l@</span></p>
<p>To copy a file without it's Extended Attributes, use <a href="cp.html">cp -X</a></p>
<p>xattr exits with zero status on success.  On error, non-zero is returned, and a message      is printed to  standard error. </p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Remove the  bundle bit from the MyApp folder and convert it back to a normal folder.</p>
<p class="code">$ xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo ~/MyApp</p>
<p>Remove all Extended Attributes from the 'example.txt' file:</p>
<p class="code">$ xattr -c example.txt</p>
<p>Remove all Extended Attributes from all the files in a directory:</p>
<p class="code">$ attr -rc /path/to/directory</p>
<p>Copy the<span class="code"> com.apple.FinderInfo</span> attribute from the<span class="code"> /usr</span> directory to the <span class="code">MyDir</span> directory: </p>
<pre>$ xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /usr
  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

$ xattr -l MyDir

$ xattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \
    "`xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /usr`" MyDir

$ xattr -l MyDir
  com.apple.FinderInfo:

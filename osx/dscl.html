<p>Directory Service command line utility<br>
 Create, read, and manage Directory Service data. If 
 invoked without any commands, dscl runs in an interactive mode, reading commands 
 from standard input. Interactive processing is terminated by the quit command. (dscl and the GUI 'Directory utility' replace the older 'NetInfo Manager')</p>

<p>Leading dashes ("-") are optional for all commands. </p>
<p>dscl operates on a datasource specified on the command line. This 
  can be a node name or a Mac OS X Server (10.2 or later) host specified by DNS 
  hostname or IP address. Node names can be absolute paths beginning with a slash 
  ("/"), or relative domain paths beginning with a dot (".") character, which 
  specifies the local domain, or "..", specifying the local domain's parent. If 
  the hostname or IP address form is used then the user must specify the -u option 
  and either the -P or -p options to specify an administrative user and password 
  on the remote host to authenticate with to the remote host. The exception to 
  this is if "localhost" is specified.</p>
<p>Passing passwords on the command line is inherently insecure
and can cause password exposure. For better security do not provide the password as part of the command and you will be securely prompted.</p>
<p>PATH SPECIFICATION<br>
<br>     
There are two modes of operation when specifying paths to operate on. The     
two modes correspond to whether the datasource is a node or a host. In     
the case of specifying a node, the top level of paths will be record     
types. Example top level paths would be:</p>
<pre>
     /Users/alice
     /Groups/admin</pre>
<p>
In the case of specifying a host as a data source, the top level of paths
correspond to Open Directory plug-ins and Search Paths. One can specify
the plug-in to traverse to a node name, after which the paths are equivalent to the former usage. The following might be the equivalent paths as
the above paths:</p>
<pre>
     /NetInfo/root/Users/alice
     /LDAPv3/10.0.1.42/Groups/admin</pre>
<p>If path components contain keys or values with embedded slash characters,
the slash characters must be escaped with a leading backslash character.
Since the shell also processes escape characters, an extra backslash is
required to correctly specify an escape.  For example, to read a mount
record with the name "ldapserver:/Users" in the "/Mounts" path, the following path would be used:</p>
<pre>    dscl . -read /Mounts/ldaphost:\/Users

     All pathnames are case-sensitive.</pre>
<p>COMMANDS<br>
<br>
The action of each command is described below.  Some commands have
aliases.  For example, "cat" and "." are aliases for "read".  Command<br>     
aliases are listed in parentheses.</p>
<pre>
   read (cat .)
   Usage: read [path [key ...]]</pre>
<p>Prints a directory.  Each of the properties are printed one per line.
The property key is followed by a colon, then a space-separated list of<br>
the values for that property.  Note that a value which contains embedded
spaces will appear identical to a pair of values.<br>
<br>
If The <span class="code">-raw</span> flag for raw output has been given, then read prints the full
DirectoryService API constant for record and attribute types.<br>
<br>
If the -url flag has been specified then printed record path attribute
values are encoded in the style of URLs. This is useful if a script or<br>
program is trying to process the output since values will not have any
spaces or other control characters.</p>
<pre>   readall
   Usage: readall [<i>path</i> [<i>key</i> ...]]</pre>
<p> readall prints all the records of a given type. The output of readall is
formatted in the same way as read with a &quot;-&quot; on a line as a delimeter<br>
between records.</p>
<pre>   readpl
   Usage: readpl <i>path key plist_path</i></pre>
<p> Prints the contents of plist_path. The plist_path is followed by a
colon, then a whitespace, and then the value for the path.</p>
<p> If the plist_path is the key for a dictionary or array, the contents of
it are displayed in plist form after the plist_path. If plist_path is<br>
the key for a string, number, bool, date, or data object, only the value
is printed out after the plist_path.</p>
<pre>   readpli
   Usage: readpli<i> path key value_index plist_path</i></pre>
<p> Prints the contents of plist_path for the plist at value_index of the
key. The plist_path is followed by a colon, then a whitespace, and then<br>
the value for the path.</p>
<p> If the plist_path is the key for a dictionary or array, the contents of
it are displayed in plist form after the plist_path. If plist_path is<br>
the key for a string, number, bool, date, or data object, only the value
is printed out after the plist_path.</p>
<pre>   list (ls)
   Usage: list <i>path</i></pre>
<p>Lists the subdirectories of the given directory.  Subdirectories are
listed one per line.  In the case of listing a search path, the names are
preceded by an index number that can act as a shortcut and used in place
of the name when specifying a path.<br>
<br>
When used in interactive mode, the path is optional.  With no path given,
the current directory will be used.</p>
<pre>
   search path key val</pre>
<p>Searches for records that match a pattern.   The search is rooted at the
given path.  The path can be a node path or a record type path.  Valid
keys are Directory Service record attribute types.</p>
<pre>
   create (mk)
   Usage: create <i>record_path</i> [<i>key</i> [<i>val</i> ...]]</pre>
<p>Creates a record, property, or value.  If only a record path is given,
the create command will create the record if it does not exist.  If a key
is given, then a property with that key will be created.<br>
<br>
WARNING - If a property with the given key already exists, it will be
destroyed and a new property will be created in its place. To add values
to an existing property, use the append or merge commands.<br>
<br>
If values are included in the command, these values will be set for the     
given key.<br>
<br>     
NOTE - Not all directory nodes support a property without a value. An     
error will be given if you attempt to create a property with no value in     
such a directory node.</p>
<pre>   createpl
   Usage: createpl <i>record_path key plist_path val1 </i>[<i>val2</i> ...]</pre>
<p> Creates a string, or array of strings at plist_path.</p>
<p> If you are creating a value at the root of a plist that is an array, simply use &quot;0&quot; as the plist_path.</p>
<p> If only val1 is specified, a string will be created at plist_path. If
val1 val2 ... are specified, an array of strings will be created at<br>
plist_path.</p>
<p> WARNING - If a value with the given plist_path already exists, it will be
destroyed and a new value will be created in its place.</p>
<pre>   createpli
   Usage: createpli <i>record_path key value_index plist_path val1 </i>[<i>val2</i> ...]</pre>
<p> Creates a string, or array of strings at plist_path for the plist at
value_index of the key.</p>
<p> If you are creating a value at the root of a plist that is an array, simply use &quot;0&quot; as the plist_path.</p>
<p> If only val1 is specified, a string will be created at plist_path. If
val1 val2 ... are specified, an array of strings will be created at<br>
plist_path.</p>
<p> WARNING - If a value with the given plist_path already exists, it will be
destroyed and a new value will be created in its place.</p>
<pre>
   append
   Usage: append <i>record_path key val</i> ...</pre>
<p>Appends one or more values to a property in a given record.  The property
is created if it does not exist.</p>
<pre>
   merge
   Usage: merge <i>record_path key val </i>...</pre>
<p>Appends one or more values to a property in a given directory if the
property does not already have those values.  <br>
The property is created if
it does not exist.</p>
<pre>
   change
   Usage: change <i>record_path key old_val new_val</i></pre>
<p>Replaces the given old value in the list of values of the given key with
the new value in the specified record.</p>
<pre>
   changi
   Usage: changei path key index val</pre>
<p>Replaces the value at the given index in the list of values of the given
key with the new value in the specified record.  index is an integer
value.  An index of 1 specifies the first value.  An index greater than
the number of values in the list will result in an error.</p>
<pre>
   diff<br>   Usage: diff path1 path2 key ...</pre>
<p> Compares the data from path1 and path2 looking at the specified keys (or
all if no keys are specified).</p>
<pre>
   delete (rm)
   Usage: delete path [key [val ...]]</pre>
<p>Delete a directory, property, or value.  If a directory path is given,
the delete command will delete the directory.  This can only be used on
record type and record paths.  If a key is given, then a property with
that key will be deleted.  If one or more values are given, those values
will be removed from the property with the given key.</p>
<pre>   deletepl
   Usage: deletepl <i>record_path key plist_path </i>[<i>val</i> ...]</pre>
<p> Deletes a value in a plist. If no values are given deletepl deletes the
plist_path. If one or more values are given, deletepl deletes the values
within plist_path.</p>
<pre>   deletepli
   Usage: deletepli <i>record_path key value_index plist_path</i> [<i>val</i> ...]</pre>
<p> Deletes a value for the plist at value_index of the key. If no values
are given deletepli deletes the plist_path. If one or more values are
given, deletepli deletes the values within plist_path.</p>
<pre>
   passwd
   Usage: passwd <i>user_path </i>[<i>new_pasword</i> | <i>old_password new_pasword</i>]</pre>
<p>Changes a password for a user. The user must be specified by full path,
not just a username.  If you are authenticated to the node (either by
specifying the -u and -P flags or by using the auth command when in
interactive node) then you can simply specify a new password.  If you are
not authenticated then the user's old password must be specified.  If
passwords are not specified while in interactive mode, you will be     
prompted for them.</p>
<p>INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
</p>
<pre>   cd
   Usage: cd <i>dir</i></pre>
<p>Sets the current directory.  Path names for other dscl commands can be
relative to the current directory.</p>
<pre>
   pushd (pd)
   Usage: pushd <i>path</i></pre>
<p>Similar to the pushd command commonly found in Unix shells.  When a path
is specified it sets the current directory while pushing the previous
directory on to the directory stack.  If no path is specified it
exchanges the top two elements of the directory stack.  It will also
print the final directory stack.</p>
<pre>
   popd
   Usage: popd</pre>
<p>Pops the directory stack and returns to the new top directory.  It will also print the final directory stack.</p>
<pre>
   auth (su)
   Usage: auth [<i>user</i> [<i>password</i>]]</pre>
<p>Authenticate as the named user, or as "root" if no user is specified.  If     
a password is supplied, then that password is used for authentication,     
otherwise the command prompts for a password.<br>
<br>     
If dscl is run in host mode, then when this command is run the current     
directory must be in the subdirectories of a node.</p>
<pre>   authonly
   Usage: authonly [user [password]]</pre>
<p> Used to verify the password of a named user, or of &quot;root&quot; if no user is
specified. If a password is supplied, then that password is used for
authentication, otherwise the command prompts for a password.</p>
<p> If dscl is run in host mode, then when this command is run the current
directory must be in the subdirectories of a node.</p>
<pre>   quit (q)
     Usage: quit</pre>
<p>
Ends processing of interactive commands and terminates the program.</p>
<pre>   command history</pre>
<p>The up and down arrow keys will scan through the command history.</p>
<pre>
   tab completion</pre>
<p>When pathnames are being typed, pressing the tab key will result in a
search to auto-complete the typed partial subdirectory name. It will also
attempt to correct capitilization in the process.</p>

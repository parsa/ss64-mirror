<p>Compare two files.<br>
  The cmp utility compares two files of any type and writes the results to the 
  standard output. By default, cmp is silent if the files are the same; if they 
  differ, the byte and line number at which the first difference occurred is reported.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      cmp [<i>option</i>..] <i>file1 </i>[<i>file2 </i>[<i>skip1 </i>[<i>skip2</i>]]]

Options
   -b  --print-bytes
              Print differing bytes.

   -i <i>SKIP</i>  --ignore-initial=<i>SKIP</i>
              Skip the first <i>SKIP</i> bytes of input.

   -i <i>SKIP1</i>:<i>SKIP2</i>  --ignore-initial=<i>SKIP1</i>:<i>SKIP2</i>
              Skip the first SKIP1 bytes of FILE1 and the first SKIP2 bytes of
              FILE2.

   -l  --verbose
              Output byte numbers and values of all differing bytes.

   -n <i>LIMIT</i>  --bytes=<i>LIMIT</i>
              Compare at most <i>LIMIT</i> bytes.

   -s  --quiet  --silent
              Output nothing; yield exit status only.

   -v  --version
              Output version info.

   --help Output help.</pre>
<p><b>Notes<br>
  </b><i>skip1</i> and <i>skip2</i> are the number of bytes to skip in each file. SKIP
values can be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes: kB
1000, K 1024, MB 1,000,000, M 1,048,576, GB 1,000,000,000, G
1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.<br>
The offset 
  is decimal by default, but can be expressed as a hex or octal value by preceding 
  it with a leading `0x' or `0'.</p>
<p><span class="code">info diff </span>will return full examples for both <span class="code">diff</span> and <span class="code">cmp</span> </p>
<p>If a <i>File</i> is<span class="code"> - </span>or missing, read from standard input.</p>
<p>cmp exits with one of the following values:</p>
<p>0 The files are identical.<br>
  1 The files are different; this includes the case where one file is identical to the first part of the other. In the latter case, if the -s option has not 
  been specified, cmp writes to standard output that EOF was reached in the shorter file (before any differences were found).<br>
  >1 An error occurred. </p>

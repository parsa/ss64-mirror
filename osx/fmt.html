</head><body><h1>fmt</h1> 
<p>Simple text formatter. Reformat paragraph text, fill and join lines to produce output 
lines of a given width (75 characters by default).</p>
<pre>Syntax
      fmt [-cmnps] [-d <i>chars</i>] [-l <i>num</i>] [-t <i>num</i>]
             [<i>goal </i>[<i>maximum</i>] | -width | -w <i>width</i>] [file ...]

Options
   -c        Center the text, line by line.  In this case, most of the other
             options are ignored; no splitting or joining of lines is done.

   -d <i>chars</i>  Treat the <i>chars</i> (and no others) as sentence-ending characters.
             By default the sentence-ending characters are full stop (`.'),
             question mark (`?') and exclamation mark (`!').  Remember that
             some characters need to be escaped to protect them from your
             shell.

   -l <i>number</i>
             Replace multiple spaces with tabs at the start of each output
             line, if possible. Each <i>number</i> spaces will be replaced with one
             tab.  The default is 8. If <i>number</i> is 0, spaces are preserved.

   -m        Try to format mail header lines contained in the input sensibly.

   -n        Format lines beginning with a `.' (dot) character. Normally, fmt
             does not fill these lines, for compatibility with nroff(1).

   -p        Allow indented paragraphs. Without the -p flag, any change in
             the amount of whitespace at the start of a line results in a new
             paragraph being begun.

   -s        Collapse whitespace inside lines, so that multiple whitespace
             characters are turned into a single space. (Or, at the end of a
             sentence, a double space.)

   -t <i>number</i>
             Assume that the input files' tabs assume <i>number</i> spaces per tab
             stop.  The default is 8.

   -w <i>width</i>  Fill output lines up to WIDTH characters (default 75).</pre>
<p><b>Notes<br></b>The fmt utility is a simple text formatter which reads the concatenation of input files (or standard input if none are given) and produces on standard output a version of its input with lines as close to the goal length as possible without exceeding the maximum. <br>
The fmt utility is meant to format mail messages prior to sending, but can also be useful for other simple tasks.</p>
<p>The <i>goal length</i> defaults to 65 and the <i>maximum length</i> to 10 more than the goal length. </p>
<p>Alternatively, a single width parameter can be specified either by prepending a hyphen to it or by using -w. </p>
<p>For example, `fmt -w 72', `fmt -72', and `fmt 72 72' all produce identical output. </p>
<p>The spacing at the beginning of the input lines is preserved in the output, as are blank lines and interword spacing. Lines are joined or split only at white space; that is, words are never joined or hyphenated.</p>

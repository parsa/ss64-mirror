<p>Install binaries.<br>
  The file(s) are copied to the target file or directory. If the destination is 
  a directory, then the file is copied into directory with its original filename.  
  If the target file already exists, it is either renamed to file.old if the -b 
  option is given or overwritten if permissions allow. An alternate backup suffix 
may be specified via the -B option's argument. </p>
<pre>Syntax
     install [-bCcMpSsv] [-B <i>suffix</i>] [-f <i>flags</i>]
                [-g <i>group</i>] [-m <i>mode</i>]
             [-o <i>owner</i>] Sourcefile1 Destinationfile2

     install [-bCcMpSsv] [-B <i>suffix</i>] [-f <i>flags</i>]
                [-g <i>group</i>] [-m <i>mode</i>]
             [-o owner] file1 ... fileN directory

     install -d [-v] [-g <i>group</i>] [-m <i>mode</i>]
                [-o <i>owner</i>] directory ...</pre>
<p><span class="body"> The 3 variants above install either a single SOURCE file 
  to DEST target<br>
  or copy multiple SOURCE files to the destination. In the last variant,<br>
  each DIRECTORY (and any missing parent directories) is created.</span> </p>
<pre>Options
     -b       Back up any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
              them to file.old.  See -B for specifying a different backup suffix.

     -B <i>suffix</i>
              Use <i>suffix</i> as the backup suffix if -b is given.

     -C       Copy the file.  If the target file already exists and the files
              are the same, then don't change the modification time of the target.

     -c       Copy the file.  This is actually the default.  The -c option is
              only included for backwards compatibility.

     -d       Create directories.  Missing parent directories are created as required.

     -f       Specify the target's file flags; see chflags(1) for a list of
              possible flags and their meanings.

     -g       Specify a group.  A numeric GID is allowed.

     -M       Disable all use of mmap(2).

     -m       Specify an alternate mode.   The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x
              (0755).  The specified mode can be either an octal or symbolic
              value; see chmod(1) for a description of possible mode values.

     -o       Specify an owner.  A numeric UID is allowed.

     -p       Preserve the modification time.  Copy the file, as if the -C
              (compare and copy) option is specified, except if the target file
              doesn't already exist or is different, then preserve the modifi-
              cation time of the file.

     -S       Safe copy.   Normally, install unlinks an existing target before
              installing the new file.  With the -S flag a temporary file is
              used and then renamed to be the target.  The reason this is safer
              is that if the copy or rename fails, the existing target is left
              untouched.

     -s       install exec's the command strip(1) to strip binaries so that
              install can be portable over a large number of systems and binary
              types.

     -v       Causes install to show when -C actually installs something.</pre>
<p>By default, install preserves all file flags, with the exception of the `nodump' flag. </p>
<p>The install utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself. Installing /dev/null creates an empty file.</p>

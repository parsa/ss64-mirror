<p>Word count, line, character, and byte count.</p>
<pre>Syntax
       wc [-clmw] [<i>file</i> ...]

Options
     -c    The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard output.

     -l    The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard output.

     -m    The number of characters in each input file is written to the
           standard output.  If the current locale does not support multi-
           byte characters, this is equivalent to the -c option.

     -w    The number of words in each input file is written to the standard output.</pre>
<p> When an option is specified, wc only reports the information requested by
that option.  The default action is equivalent to specifying the -c, -l and -w options.<br>
<br>
If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no file name is
displayed.</p>
<p>The command <a href="grep.html">grep -c</a> will also count the number of matching lines, <span class="code">grep -c</span> is faster than piping <span class="code">grep</span> to <span class="code">wc -l</span></p>
<p>The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained 
in each input file (or standard input, by default) to the standard output. </p>
<p>A 
  line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a
<new-
     line>
character, and a word is defined as a string of characters delimited 
  by white space characters. White space characters are the set of characters 
  for which the iswspace(3) function returns true.</p>
<p> If more than one input file 
  is specified, a line of cumulative counts for all the files is displayed on 
  a separate line after the output for the last file. </p>
<p> The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the 
  execution of wc as described in environ(7).</p>
<p>Exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p> Count the number of characters, words and lines in each of the files<br>
report1 and report2 as well as the totals for both:</p>
<pre>$ wc -mlw report1 report2
</pre>
<p>Count the number of words by pasting from the clipboard: </p>
<p><span class="code">$ wc -l<br>
(paste the list into the window and then type CTRL-D)</span></p>

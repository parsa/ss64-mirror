</head><body><h1>security</h1> 
<p>Administer Keychains, keys, certificates and the Security framework.</p>
<p>By default security will execute the <i>command</i> supplied and report if anything went wrong.

If the<span class="code"> -i </span>or<span class="code"> -p </span>options are provided, security will enter interactive mode.  When EOF is read from stdin security will exit.</p>
<pre>Syntax
     security [-hilqv] [-p <i>prompt</i>] [<i>command</i>] [<i>command_options</i>] [<i>command_args</i>]

Key
   -h     If no arguments are specified, show a list of all commands.
          If arguments are provided, show usage for each the specified commands.
          This option is essentially the same as the help command.

   -i     Run security in interactive mode.
          A prompt (security> by default) will be displayed and the
          user will be able to type commands on stdin until an EOF is encountered.

   -l     Before security exits, run
             /usr/bin/leaks -nocontext
          on itself to see if the command(s) you executed had any leaks.

   -p <i>prompt</i>
         Implies the -i option but changes the default prompt to the argument specified
              instead.

   -q    Will make security less verbose.

   -v    Will make security more verbose.

<p>SECURITY COMMANDS<br>
security provides a rich variety of <span class="code">commands</span> , each of which often has a 
wealth of options, to allow access to the broad functionality provided by the Security framework.  However, you don't have to master every detail for security to be useful to you.</p>

Common options:
     Command_options that are available across all security commands.

     -h   Show a usage message for the specified command.
          This option is essentially the same as the help command.</pre>
<p>Environment<br>
<span class="code">MallocStackLogging</span><br>
When using the leaks command or the -l option it's probably a good idea to set this environment variable before security is started.  Doing so will allow leaks to display symbolic backtraces.<br>
<br>
Files<br>
<span class="code">~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist</span><br>

Property list file containing the current user's default keychain and keychain search list.<br>
<span class="code"><br>
/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist</span><br>

Property list file containing the system default keychain and keychain search list.  This is
used by processes started at boot time, or those requesting to use the system search domain,
such as system daemons.<br>
<br>
<span class="code">/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security-common.plist</span><br>

Property list file containing the common keychain search list, which is appended to every
user's search list and to the system search list.<br>
<br>

History<br>
security was first introduced in Mac OS X version 10.3.<br>
<br>
Bugs<br>
security still needs more commands before it can be considered complete.  In particular, it should
someday supersede both the certtool and systemkeychain commands.</p>

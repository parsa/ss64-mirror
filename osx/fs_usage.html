</head><body><h1>fs_usage</h1> 
<p>Filesystem usage (process/pathname)
Requires root privileges due to the kernel tracing facility it uses to operate.</p>
<pre>Syntax
     fs_usage [-e] [-w] [-f <i>mode</i>] [<i>pid</i>|<i>cmd</i> [<i>pid</i>|<i>cmd</i>] ...]

Options
    -e     Generate output that excludes the running fs_usage tool.
           If a list of process ids or commands is also given, then
           those are also excluded.

    -w     Force a wider, more detailed output, regardless of the window size.

    -f     Turn on output filtering based on the mode provided.
           By default no filtering occurs. The supported
           modes are: network  Only network related output is displayed.
                      filesys  Only file system related output is displayed.</pre>
<P> By default
the activity monitored includes all system processes except the running
fs_usage process, Terminal, telnetd, sshd, rlogind, tcsh, csh and sh.<br>
These defaults can be overridden such that output is limited to include
or exclude a list of processes specified by the user.</P>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Monitor all filesystem activity:<br>
<span class="code">$ sudo fs_usage</span><br>
[then ctrl-C to cancel]<br>
<br>
Watch  iTunes manipulate files:<br>
<span class="code">$ sudo fs_usage iTunes</span><br>
</p> 
<h2>Output columns:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>TIMESTAMP 
TOD when call occurred. Wide mode will have millisecond granularity.</p>
<p> CALL The name of the network or filesystem related call, page-in,
page-out or physical disk access.</p>
<p> FILE DESCRIPTOR<br>
Of the form F=x, x is a file descriptor. Depending on the type
of system call, this will be either an input value or a return<br>
value.</p>
<p> BYTE COUNT<br>
Of the form B=x, x is the number of bytes requested by the call.</p>
<p> [ERRNO]<br>
On error, the errno is displayed in brackets.</p>
<p> PATHNAME<br>
Pathname of the file accessed (up to the last 28 bytes).</p>
<p> FAULT ADDRESS<br>
Of the form A=0xnnnnnnnn, where 0xnnnnnnnn is the address being
faulted.</p>
<p> DISK BLOCK NUMBER<br>
Of the form D=0xnnnnnnnn, where 0xnnnnnnnn is the block number of
the physical disk block being read or written.</p>
<p> OFFSET Of the form O=0xnnnnnnnn, where 0xnnnnnnnn is a file offset.</p>
<p> SELECT RETURN<br>
Of the form S=x, x is the number of ready descriptors returned by
the select() system call. If S=0, the time limit expired.</p>
<p> TIME INTERVAL(W)<br>
The elapsed time spent in the system call. A `W' after the
elapsed time indicates the process was scheduled out during this<br>
file activity. In this case, the elapsed time includes the wait
time.</p>
<p> PROCESS NAME<br>
The process that made the system call.</p>

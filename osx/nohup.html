</head><body><h1>nohup</h1> 
<p>Run a command immune to hangups, runs the given <i>Command</i> 
  with hangup signals (SIGHUP) ignored, so that the command can continue running in the 
background after you log out.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      nohup [<i>Command</i> [<i>Arg</i>]...]         </pre>
<p> Run <i>command</i> such that it will ignore hangup signals. </p>
<p>Note that commands can set their own response to hangups, overriding 
  nohup. </p>
<p>Without an argument (allowed in only a shell script), causes the 
  shell to ignore hangups for the remainder of the script. `nohup' does not automatically 
  put the command it runs in the background; you must do that explicitly, by ending 
  the command line with an `&'. </p>
<p>If the output file nohup.out cannot be created in the current directory, the nohup
utility uses the directory named by the variable HOME to create the file.</p>
<p>If the standard output is a terminal, the standard output is
appended to the file nohup.out in the current directory. <br>
If standard error is a terminal, it is directed to the same place as the standard output.</p>
<p> Exit Status<br>
126 The utility was found but could not be invoked.<br> 127 The utility could not be found or an error occurred in nohup.<br> Otherwise, the exit status of nohup shall be that of utility.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>bash script that takes any simple command and runs it in the background. Logging output and error output to <span class="code">~/launch</span> The output files are suffixed with the date and time.</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash
<a href="mkdir.html">mkdir</a> -p ~/launch
logfilename=&quot;${1##*/}_$(<a href="date.html">date</a> +%F_%H%M%S)&quot;
echo "== LAUNCH $@ ==" > ~/launch/${logfilename}_stdout.log
echo "== LAUNCH $@ ==" > ~/launch/${logfilename}_stderr.log
nohup "$@" >>~/launch/${logfilename}_stdout.log 2>>~/launch/${logfilename}_stderr.log &</pre>

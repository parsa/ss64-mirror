<p>Change file timestamps. Sets the modification and access times 
  of files to the current time of day. If the file doesn't exist, it is created 
with default permissions.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      touch [-acfhm] [-r <i>file</i>] [-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]] <i>file</i> ...

Options
     
<b>     -a</b>   Change the access time of the file.  The modification time of the
          file is not changed unless the <b>-m</b> flag is also specified.

     <b>-c</b>   Do not create the file if it does not exist.  The <b>touch</b> utility
          does not treat this as an error.  No error messages are displayed
          and the exit value is not affected.

     <b>-f</b>   Attempt to force the update, even if the file permissions do not
          currently permit it.

     <b>-h</b>   If the file is a symbolic link, change the times of the link
          itself rather than the file that the link points to.  Note that
          <b>-h</b> implies <b>-c</b> and thus will not create any new files.

     <b>-m</b>   Change the modification time of the file. The access time of the
          file is not changed unless the <b>-a</b> flag is also specified.

     <b>-r</b>   Use the access and modifications times from the specified file
          instead of the current time of day.

     <b>-t</b>   Change the access and modification times to the specified time.
          The argument should be in the form `[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]'
          where each pair of letters represents the following:

           <i>CC</i>    The first two digits of the year (the century).
           <i>YY</i>    The second two digits of the year.  If ``YY'' is
          specified, but ``CC'' is not, a value for ``YY''
          between 69 and 99 results in a ``CC'' value of 19.
          Otherwise, a ``CC'' value of 20 is used.
           <i>MM</i>    The month of the year, from 1 to 12.
           <i>DD</i>    the day of the month, from 1 to 31.
           <i>hh</i>    The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
           <i>mm</i>    The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
           <i>SS</i>    The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.

          If the `CC' and `YY' letter pairs are not specified, the val-
          ues default to the current year.  If the `SS' letter pair is
          not specified, the value defaults to 0.

Example
   touch 0512301259 MyFile.txt</pre>
<p>The obsolescent form of touch, where a time format is specified as the 
  first argument, is supported. </p>
<p>When no -r or -t option is specified, there are 
  at least two arguments, and the first argument is a string of digits either 
  eight or ten characters in length, the first argument is interpreted as a time 
  specification of the form `MMDDhhmm[YY]'. The `MM', `DD', `hh' and `mm' letter 
  pairs are treated as their counterparts specified to the -t option. </p>
<p>If the `YY' 
  letter pair is in the range 39 to 99, the year is set to 1939 to 1999, otherwise, 
  the year is set in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs. </p>

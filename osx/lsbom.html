<p>List the contents of an installer's bom (bill of materials) file. 
  This can be used to find out what files an installer will add/replace in your 
system before running it. It can also list details of a previous install.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      lsbom [<i>options</i>] [--arch <i>archVal</i>] [-p <i>parameters</i>] bom ...

     -b     list block devices

     -c     list character devices

     -p parameters
     print only some of the results Note: each option can only be
     used once:
           c       32-bit checksum
           f       file name
           F       file name with quotes (ie "/usr/bin/lsbom")
           g       group id
           G       group name
           m       file mode (permissions)
           M       symbolic file mode (ie "dr-xr-xr-x")
           s       file size
           S       formatted size
           t       mod time
           T       formatted mod time
           u       user id
           U       user name
           /       user id/group id
           ?       user name/group name</pre>
<p><span class="body"> For each file in a bom, lsbom prints the file path and/or 
  requested information. If no options are given, lsbom will display the output 
  formatted such that each line contains the path of the entry, its mode (octal), 
  and its UID/GID. There are slight differences in the output for plain files, 
  directories, symbolic links, and device files.</span></p>
<p>The -p option can be used to specify a user-defined format for lsbom's output. 
  The format string consists of one or more characters described above where each 
  character represents a datatype. </p>
<p>Datatypes will be separated by tab characters, and each line will end with 
  a newline character. One can use this mechanism to create output similar to 
  the <a href="ls.html">ls</a> command.<br>
</p>

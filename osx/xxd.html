<p>Make a hexdump or do the reverse. <br>
xxd creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input. It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form. Like  <a href="uuencode.html">uuencode</a> and <a href="uuencode.html">uudecode</a> it allows the transmission of binary data in an 'email-safe' <a href="../ascii.html">ASCII</a> representation, but has the advantage of decoding to standard output. Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file patching.</p>
<pre>Syntax

      xxd [<i>options</i>] [<i>infile</i> [<i>outfile</i>]]

      xxd -r[evert] [<i>options</i>] [<i>infile</i> [<i>outfile</i>]]

      xxd -h[elp]

Options
      If no infile is given, standard input is read.  If infile is  specified
       as  a  '-'  character,  then input is taken from standard input.  If no
       outfile is given (or a '-' character is in its place), results are sent
       to standard output.

       Note  that  a  "lazy" parser is used which does not check for more than
       the first option letter, unless the option is followed by a  parameter.
       Spaces  between  a single option letter and its parameter are optional.
       Parameters to options can be specified in decimal, hexadecimal or octal
       notation.  Thus -c8, -c 8, -c 010 and -cols 8 are all equivalent.


       -a | -autoskip
              toggle  autoskip: A single '*' replaces nul-lines.  Default off.

       -b | -bits
              Switch to bits (binary digits) dump, rather than hexdump.   This
              option  writes octets as eight digits "1"s and "0"s instead of a
              normal hexadecimal dump. Each line is preceded by a line  number
              in  hexadecimal and followed by an ascii (or ebcdic) representa-
              tion. The command line switches -r, -p, -i do not work with this
              mode.

       -c <i>cols</i> | -cols <i>cols</i>
              format  <i>cols</i> octets per line. Default 16 (-i: 12, -ps: 30, -b:
              6). Max 256.

       -E | -EBCDIC
              Change the character encoding in the righthand column from ASCII
              to EBCDIC.  This does not change the hexadecimal representation.
              The option is meaningless in combinations with -r, -p or -i.

       -g bytes | -groupsize <i>bytes</i>
              separate the output of every <i>bytes</i> bytes (two  hex  characters
              or eight bit-digits each) by a whitespace.  Specify -g 0 to sup-
              press grouping.  <i>Bytes</i> defaults to 2 in normal mode and  1  in
              bits  mode.   Grouping  does  not apply to postscript or include
              style.

       -h | -help
              print a summary of available commands and exit.  No hex  dumping
              is performed.

       -i | -include
              output  in C include file style. A complete static array defini-
              tion is written (named after the input file), unless  xxd  reads
              from stdin.

       -l len | -len <i>len</i>
              stop after writing <i>len</i> octets.

       -p | -ps | -postscript | -plain
              output  in  postscript  continuous  hexdump style. Also known as
              plain hexdump style.

       -r | -revert
              reverse operation: convert (or patch) hexdump into  binary.   If
              not  writing  to stdout, xxd writes into its output file without
              truncating it. Use the combination -r -p to read plain hexadeci-
              mal dumps without line number information and without a particu-
              lar column layout. Additional  Whitespace  and  line-breaks  are
              allowed anywhere.

       -seek <i>offset</i>
              When used after -r: revert with <i>offset</i> added to file positions
              found in hexdump.

       -s [+][-]<i>seek</i>
              start at <i>seek</i> bytes abs. (or rel.) infile offset.  + indicates
              that  the  seek  is  relative to the current stdin file position
              (meaningless when not reading from stdin).  - indicates that the
              seek  should  be  that many characters from the end of the input
              (or if combined with +: before the current stdin file position).
              Without -s option, xxd starts at the current file position.

       -u     use upper case hex letters. Default is lower case.

       -v | -version
              show version string.

CAVEATS

       xxd -r has some builtin magic while evaluating line number information.
       If the output file is seekable, then the linenumbers at  the  start  of
       each  hexdump  line may be out of order, lines may be missing, or over-
       lapping. In these cases xxd will lseek(2) to the next position. If  the
       output  file  is  not  seekable,  only  gaps are allowed, which will be
       filled by null-bytes.

       xxd -r never generates parse errors. Garbage is silently skipped.

       When editing hexdumps, please note that xxd -r skips everything on  the
       input line after reading enough columns of hexadecimal data (see option
       -c). This also means, that changes to the printable ascii  (or  ebcdic)
       columns  are  always  ignored.  Reverting a plain (or postscript) style
       hexdump with xxd -r -p does not depend on the correct  number  of  col-
       umns.  Here  anything  that  looks  like a pair of hex-digits is inter-
       preted.

       Note the difference between
       % xxd -i file
       and
       % xxd -i &lt; file

       xxd -s +seek may be different from xxd -s seek, as lseek(2) is used  to
       "rewind" input.  A '+' makes a difference if the input source is stdin,
       and if stdin's file position is not at the start of  the  file  by  the
       time  xxd  is  started and given its input.  The following examples may
       help to clarify (or further confuse!)...

       Rewind stdin before reading; needed because the `cat' has already  read
       to the end of stdin.
       % sh -c "cat &gt; plain_copy; xxd -s 0 &gt; hex_copy" &lt; file

       Hexdump  from  file  position  0x480 (=1024+128) onwards.  The `+' sign
       means "relative to the current position", thus the `128' adds to the 1k
       where dd left off.
       %  sh -c "dd of=plain_snippet bs=1k count=1; xxd -s +128 &gt; hex_snippet"
       &lt; file

       Hexdump from file position 0x100 ( = 1024-768) on.
       % sh -c "dd of=plain_snippet bs=1k count=1; xxd -s +-768 &gt; hex_snippet"
       &lt; file

       However,  this is a rare situation and the use of `+' is rarely needed.
       The author prefers to monitor the  effect  of  xxd  with  strace(1)  or
       truss(1), whenever -s is used.

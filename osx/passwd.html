<p>Modify a user password.<br>
  First, the user is prompted for their current password. If the current password 
  is correctly typed, a new password is requested. The new password must be entered 
twice to avoid typing errors.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      passwd [-i <i>infosystem</i>] [-l <i>location</i>] [-u <i>authname</i>] [name]

Key
    -i <i>infosystem</i>
           This option specifies where the password update should be applied.
          Under Mac OS X 10.5 and later, supported directory systems are:

            PAM   (default)  Pluggable Authentication Modules.
            opendirectory    A system conforming to Open Directory APIs and supporting
                             updates (including LDAP, etc).
                             If no -l option is specified, the search node is used.
            file  The local flat-files (included for legacy configurations).
            nis   A remote NIS server containing the user's password.

    -l <i>location</i>
          This option causes the password to be updated in the given location
          of the chosen directory system.
            for file,
                  location can be a file name (/etc/master.passwd is the
                  default)
            for nis,
                  location can be a NIS domainname
            for opendirectory,
                  location can be a directory node name
            for PAM,
                  location is not used

     -u <i>authname</i>
            This option specifies the user name to use when authenticating to
            the directory node.

     <i>user</i>  This optional argument specifies the user account whose password
           will be changed.  This account's current password might be required,
           even when run as the super-user, depending on the directory system.</pre>
<p>The new password should be at least six characters long and not 
  purely alphabetic. Its total length should be less than _PASSWORD_LEN (currently 
  128 characters) although some infosystems allow longer passwords. </p>
<p>Numbers, upper case letters and meta characters are encouraged. 
  Once the password has been verified, passwd communicates the new password information 
  to the authenticating host.</p>

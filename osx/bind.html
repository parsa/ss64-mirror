</head><body><h1>bind</h1> 
<p>Display current readline key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a readline function or macro, or set a readline variable. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      bind [-m <i>keymap</i>] [-lpsvPSV] 
      bind [-m <i>keymap</i>] [-q <i>function</i>] [-u <i>function</i>] [-r <i>keyseq</i>] 
      bind [-m <i>keymap</i>] -f <i>filename</i> 
      bind [-m <i>keymap</i>] -x <i>keyseq</i>:<i>shell-command</i> 
      bind [-m <i>keymap</i>] <i>keyseq</i>:<i>function-name</i> or <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bindable-Readline-Commands.html">readline-command</a></i>
</pre>
<p> Each non-option argument is a command as it would appear in <span class="code">.inputrc</span>, but each binding or command must be passed as a separate argument; e.g., <span class="code">'&quot;\C-x\C-r&quot;: re-read-init-file'</span>. <br>
</p>
<pre>Key

   -m <i>keymap</i>    Use <i>keymap</i> as the keymap to be affected by the subsequent bindings.
                Acceptable keymap names are emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi,
                vi-move, vi-command, and vi-insert. vi is equivalent to vi-command;
                emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.

   -l           List the <b>names</b> of all readline functions.

   -p           Display readline function names and bindings in such a way that they can be re-read.

   -P           List current readline function names and bindings.

   -s           Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output in such a way that
                they can be re-read.

   -S           Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.

   -v           Display readline variable names and values in such a way that they can be re-read.

   -V           List current readline variable <b>names</b> and <b>values</b>.

   -f <i>filename</i>  Read key bindings from <i>filename</i>.

   -q <i>function</i>  Query about which keys invoke the named function.

   -u <i>function</i>  Unbind all keys bound to the named function.

   -r <i>keyseq</i>    Remove any current binding for <i>keyseq</i>.

   -x <i>keyseq</i>:<i>shell-command</i>   Cause <i>shell-command</i> to be executed whenever keyseq is entered.
                When shell-command is executed, the shell sets the READLINE_LINE variable to the
                contents of the readline line buffer and the READLINE_POINT variable to the current
                location of the insertion point. If the executed command changes the value of
                READLINE_LINE or READLINE_POINT, those new values will be reflected in the editing state.</pre>
<p> The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurred.</p>
<p>You can determine the character sequence emitted by a key by pressing <span class="code">Ctrl-v</span> at the command line, then pressing the key you're interested in. Alternatively run the <a href="read.html">read</a> command and then press the key(s) of interest, Control-c will return from the read builtin command.</p>
<p>The <span class="code">\e</span> is the escape character, displayed as <span class="code">^[</span> in the shell output. </p>
<p>bind is an internal command; bind key mappings can be abbreviated by ommiting the <span class="code">bind</span> command and the outer set of single quotes.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Setup the shell to perform a <a href="history.html">history</a> search when the Up and Down arrow keys are used. <br>
This allows typing part of a command and then using the arrows to select matching commands from history.<br>
(by default Up and Down will just select previous commands without any matching against history.)</p>
<p class="code">bind '&quot;\e[A&quot;:history-search-backward' <br>
bind '&quot;\e[B&quot;:history-search-forward'<br>
bind '&quot;\e[C&quot;: forward-char'<br>
bind '&quot;\e[D&quot;: backward-char'</p>
<p>The last two bindings ensure that the left and right keys continue to work correctly.</p>

<p>  ipconfig is a utility that communicates with the IPConfiguration agent to
  retrieve and set IP configuration parameters.  It should only be used in
  a test and debug context.  Using it for any other purpose is strongly
  discouraged.  Public API's in the SystemConfiguration framework are currently the only supported way to access and control the state of IPConfiguration.<br>
  <br>
  The IPConfiguration agent is responsible for configuring and managing the
  IP addresses on direct, connectionless interfaces such as IEEE 802.3 Ethernet and IEEE 1394 FireWire.  The IPConfiguration agent is a program
  bundle that is loaded and executed by the configd(8) process.<br>
  <br>
  The IPConfiguration agent implements the client side of the DHCP and
  BOOTP protocols described in RFC951, RFC1542, RFC2131, and RFC2132.  It also assigns and maintains static IP addresses.  It can also allocate and
  assign a link-local IP address if DHCP fails to acquire an IP address.<br>
  <br>
  In all cases, the IPConfiguration agent performs IP address conflict
  detection before assigning an IP address to an interface.</p>
<pre>COMMANDS

     The ipconfig utility provides several commands:

     waitall     Blocks until all network services have completed configuring,
                 or have timed out in the process of configuring.  This is
                 only useful for initial system start-up time synchronization
                 for legacy network services that are incapable of dealing
                 with dynamic network configuration changes.

     getifaddr <i>interface-name</i>
                 Prints to standard output the IP address for the first net-
                 work service associated with the given interface.  The output
                 will be empty if no service is currently configured or active
                 on the interface.

     ifcount     Prints the number of interfaces that IPConfiguration is capa-
                 ble of configuring.  The value that's printed will not change
                 unless relevant network interfaces are either added to or
                 removed from the system.

     getoption <i>interface-name</i> (<i>option-name</i> | <i>option-code</i>)
                 Prints the BOOTP/DHCP option with the given name or option
                 code integer value.  See bootpd(8) for option code names.  If
                 an option has multiple values e.g. domain_name_server, only
                 the first value is printed.

     getpacket <i>interface-name</i>
                 Prints to standard output the DHCP/BOOTP packet that the
                 client accepted from the DHCP/BOOTP server.  This command is
                 useful to check what the server provided, and whether the
                 values are sensible.  This command outputs nothing if
                 DHCP/BOOTP is not active on the interface, or the attempt to
                 acquire an IP address was unsuccessful.

     getv6packet <i>interface-name</i>
                 Prints to standard output the latest DHCPv6 packet that the
                 client accepted from the DHCPv6 server.  In the case of
                 stateful DHCPv6, it corresponds to the last packet from the
                 server that contained addressing information.  This command
                 is useful to check what the server provided, and whether the
                 values are sensible.  This command outputs nothing if DHCPv6
                 is not active on the interface.

     set <i>interface-name</i> NONE
     set <i>interface-name</i> (DHCP | BOOTP)
     set <i>interface-name</i> (MANUAL | INFORM) ip-address subnet-mask
     set <i>interface-name</i> NONE-V6
     set <i>interface-name</i> AUTOMATIC-V6
     set <i>interface-name</i> MANUAL-V6 ipv6-address prefix-length
     set <i>interface-name</i> 6TO4
                 Sets the interface to have a new temporary network service of
                 the given type.  Any existing services on the interface for
                 the particular protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) are first de-config-
                 ured before the new service is instantiated.

                 If NONE is specified, all existing IPv4 services are de-con-
                 figured.  If NONE-V6 is specified, all existing IPv6 services
                 are de-configured.

                 DHCP and BOOTP require no additional arguments. The IP
                 address, subnet mask, router, and DNS information are
                 retrieved automatically.

                 Both MANUAL and INFORM require the specification of an IP
                 address ip-address and a subnet mask subnet-mask.

                 The INFORM service configures the IP address statically like
                 MANUAL, but then broadcasts DHCP INFORM packets to retrieve
                 DHCP option information. If the DHCP server responds and sup-
                 plies a subnet mask, that subnet mask is used instead of the
                 specified subnet-mask.

                 AUTOMATIC-V6 requires no additional arguments.  The IPv6
                 address, prefix length and router are retrieved automati-
                 cally.

                 MANUAL-V6 requires the specification of the IPv6 address
                 ipv6-address and a prefix length prefix-length.

                 6TO4 only works on Six To Four (IFT_STF) interfaces e.g.
                 stf0.  If it is specified on a non-IFT_STF interface, it has
                 the same effect as specifying NONE-V6.

                 The set command requires root privileges.

                 Note: The set command is very useful for debugging, but it
                 can't be used to configure a persistent service.  The tempo-
                 rary services that are created only remain until the next
                 network configuration change occurs. See scselect(8).

     setverbose <i>level</i>
                 Sets verbose mode logging in the IPConfiguration agent. Spec-
                 ify a level value of 0 to disable verbose logging, the
                 default.  Specify a value of 1 to enable verbose logging.

                 When enabled, useful debugging information is logged using
                 syslog(3) with level LOG_NOTICE.  In addition, the packet
                 trace file /var/log/com.apple.IPConfiguration.bootp is opened
                 and BOOTP/DHCP packets that are sent and received are printed
                 to the file.

                 The setverbose command requires root privileges.</pre>

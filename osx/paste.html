<pre>Syntax
       paste [-s] [-d <i>list</i>] <i>file</i> ...

Options
     -d <i>list     </i>Use one or more of the provided characters to replace the
                 newline characters instead of the default tab.  The charac-
                 ters in list are used circularly, i.e., when list is exhaust-
                 ed the first character from list is reused.  This continues
                 until a line from the last input file (in default operation)
                 or the last line in each file (using the -s option) is dis-
                 played, at which time paste begins selecting characters from
                 the beginning of list again.

                 The following special characters can also be used in list:

                 \n    newline character
                 \t    tab character
                 \\    backslash character
                 \0    Empty string (not a null character).

                 Any other character preceded by a backslash is equivalent to
                 the character itself.

     -s          Concatenate all of the lines of each separate input file in
                 command line order.  The newline character of every line ex-
                 cept the last line in each input file is replaced with the
                 tab character, unless otherwise specified by the -d option.</pre>
<p>If `-' is specified for one or more of the input files, the standard input is used; standard input is read one line at a time, circularly, for each instance of `-'. </p>
<p>paste exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.</p>

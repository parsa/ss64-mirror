<title>RMAN Point-In-Time Recovery Example  | Oracle | SS64.com</title>
</head><body><h1><a href="rman.html">RMAN</a> <code>Point-In-Time Recovery Example </code></h1>
<p>There are many ways to restore a database using an RMAN backup - this example assumes you are running RMAN without a Catalog and are performing a Restore &amp; Point-In-Time Recovery of all data back to a particular date/time in the past. </p>
<p>If you are running in Archive log mode and recover without specifying a date/time then RMAN will apply all Archived logs it can find, ofter recovering the database right back to the time when you started the restore operation! </p>
<p>If you are running in Archive log mode (and you should be), point-in time is probably the most common recovery scenario. </p>
<p>You will need  the following information: </p>
<p>Database SID: ________ </p>
<p>Database SYS password: ________</p>
<p>The Date and Time to restore to : ________</p>
<p>There are  5 steps to   recover the database:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> 1) Restore backup files from tape <br>
2) Mount the  instance <br>
3) Restore the datafiles<br>
4) Recover the database<br> 
5) Reset the logs
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Restore backup files from tape</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are looking to restore the database to a time of (say 09:00) you will need the most recent RMAN backup files prior to the date (say 23:00 from the previous day) plus all the archive logs from the backup time until the restore time, in this case from 23:00 until 09:00.</p>
<p>If any of these files have been moved (e.g. archived to tape) restore them to the default locations on the oracle database server.</p>
<p>Set the environment variable NLS_LANG for your character set - <br>
<span class="code">NLS_LANG=American_America.WE8ISO8859P1</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mount the  instance</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="code">C:\&gt; Set ORACLE_SID=Live<br>
C:\&gt; rman TARGET SYS/<i>Password</i> NOCATALOG</p>
<p><span class="code">RMAN:&gt; shutdown immediate;<br>
RMAN:&gt; startup mount;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Restore and recover the datafiles</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="code">RMAN&gt; run<br>
{<br>
allocate channel dev1 type disk;<br>
set until time &quot;to_date('2011-12-30:00:00:00', 'yyyy-mm-dd:hh24:mi:ss')&quot;;<br>
restore database;<br>
recover database; }</p>
<p> For a large database it can take a long time to restore each tablespace - for better performance during a restore place the RMAN backup files on a separate disk to the Oracle datafiles to reduce disk contention. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open the database and reset logs </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="code">RMAN&gt; alter database open resetlogs; </p>
<p>This will update all current datafiles and online redo logs and all subsequent archived redo logs with a new RESETLOGS SCN and time stamp.</p>
<p>As soon as you have done a resetlogs <b>run a full backup</b>, this is important as should you suffer a second failure you will not be able to perform a second recovery because after resetting the logs the SCN numbers will no longer match any older backup files. </p>

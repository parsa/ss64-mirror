<p>When designing a database it's a good idea to follow some sort of naming convention. 
  This will involve a little thought in the early design stages but will save 
  significant time when maintaining the finished system.<br>
  <br>
  It's less important which exact conventions you choose to follow - but this 
  page has a few suggestions.<br>
  <br>
  The benefits of using a naming convention are more to do with human factors 
  than any system limitations - but this does not make them any less important.</p>
<p><b>Table Names</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Table names are <i>plural</i>, field name is <i>singular</i><br>
      <br>
      Table names should not contain spaces, words should be split_up_with_underscores.</p>
<p>The table name is limited to 30 bytes which should equal a 30 character name (try a <span class="code">DESC ALL_TABLES</span> and note the size of the Table_Name column) <br>
  <br>
  If the table name contains serveral words, only the last one should be plural:<br>
  <span class="code">APPLICATIONS <br>
  APPLICATION_FUNCTIONS <br>
  APPLICATION_FUNCTION_ROLES </span><br>
  <br>
  There are pros and cons to adding a prefix or suffix to identify tables-<br>
<br>
Pros: If most  access will be made via VIEWS then prefixing all the tables with <span class="code">T_</span> and all the views with <span class="code">V_</span> keeps things organised neatly,  you will never accidentally query the wrong one.<br>
<br>
Cons:
Suppose, 
  your naming convention is to have the '_TAB' suffix for all tables. According 
  to that naming convention, the APPLICATIONS table would be called APPLICATIONS_TAB. 
  If as time goes by, your application gets a second login, perhaps for auditing, 
  or for security reasons. To avoid code changes, you will then have to create 
  a View or Synonym that points at the original tables and is confusingly called APPLICATIONS_TAB. <br>
<br>
Of course if all your code is written against Views in the first place then you will skirt right around this issue.</p>
</blockquote>
  
</blockquote>
<p><b> Field Names</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Ideally each field name should be unique within the database schema. This makes it easy to search through a large set of code (or documentation) and find all occurences of the field name. <br>
      <br>
      The convention is to prefix the fieldname with a 2 or 3 character contraction 
  of the table name e.g.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span class="code">PATIENT_OPTIONS</span> would have a field called <span class="code">po_patient_option</span></p>
      <p><span class="code">PATIENT_RELATIVES</span> would have a field called <span class="code">pr_relative_name</span></p>
      <p><span class="code">APPOINTMENTS</span> would have a field called <span class="code">ap_date</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In a large schema you will often find two tables having similar names which 
      could result in the same prefix. You can avoid this by thinking carefully 
      about the name you give each table - and documenting the prefixes to be 
  used.</p>
<p>One advantage of this prefix is that you are very unlikely to choose a <b>reserved</b> word by accident. <br>
  <br>
  For very complex systems (thousands of tables) consider alternatives e.g. 
a prefix/suffix to identify the Application module. </p>
<p>Keeping names short: Oracle places no limit on the number of columns in
      a GROUP BY clause or
      the number of sort specifications in an ORDER BY clause. However, the
      sum of the sizes of all such expressions is limited to the size of an Oracle
      data block (specified by the initialization parameter DB_BLOCK_SIZE) minus
      some
    overhead.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
</blockquote>
<p><b>Primary Key Fields </b>- indicate by appending <b>_pk</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>e.g.</p>
    <p><span class="code">PATIENTS</span> would have a primary key called <span class="code">pa_patient_id_pk</span><br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">REGIONS</span> would have a primary key called <span class="code">re_region_id_pk </span></p>
    <p>And so on…the name of the primary key field being a singular version 
      of the table name. Other tables containing this as a foreign key would omit 
      the _PK<br>
      <br>
      so<br>
      <span class="code">CLINIC_ATTENDANCE</span> might then have a foreign key called <span class="code">ca_patient_id</span><br>
      or alternatively: <span class="code">ca_patient_id_fk</span><br>
      <br>
      Tables with Compound PK's, use <b>_ck</b> in place of _pk<br>
      <br>
      Notice that where several tables use the same PK as part of a compound foreign 
    key then the only unique part of the FK fieldname will be the table prefix.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>View Names</b></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>View names are <i>plural</i>, field name is <i>singular</i><br>
<br>
View names should not contain spaces, words should be split_up_with_underscores.</p>
<p> While it is  common to prefix (or suffix) all views with <span class="code">V_ </span>or  <span class="code">VW_</span>, a strong argument can be made  that neither are really needed. </p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to boost the performance of an application is to provide, at an early stage in the design, a carefully tuned set of views, then write all the application code against those Views.<br>
Giving your Views friendly easy names will promote their use by developers and end-users, this in turn will mean fewer badly written queries and more use of 'shared SQL' which will improve the cache hit ratio.</p>
<p>For very large systems, it can make sense to prefix tables/views with the application module name, so a database holding data for both Widget Production and Human Resources data might prefix everything with either HR_ or WP_ </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Index names</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Name the Primary Key index as <b>idx_</b>&lt;TableName&gt;<b>_pk </b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>e.g.<br>
        <span class="code">PATIENTS</span> would have a primary key index called <span class="code">idx_patients_pk</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Name a Unique Index as <b>idx_</b>&lt;TableName&gt;<b>_uk </b></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>e.g.<br>
        <span class="code">PATIENTS</span> would have a unique index called<span class="code"> idx_patients_uk</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Where more indexes are added to the same table, simply append a numeric:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>idx_</b>&lt;TableName&gt;<b>_## </b></p>
        <p>Where ## is a simple number</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>e.g.<br>
        <span class="code">PATIENTS</span> would have additional indexes called<span class="code"> idx_patients_01, idx_patients_02</span>,…</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><i>Note - Conventions that attempt to use the column name as part of the 
      index name become unmanageable as soon as you have multiple columns appearing 
      in multiple indexes.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Constraints </b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> Primary and Unique constraints will be explicitly named.<br>
      <br>
      Name the Primary Key Constraint as <b>pk_</b>&lt;TableName&gt;</p>
    <blockquote><p> e.g.<br>
        <span class="code">PATIENTS</span> would have a primary key index called <span class="code">pk_patients</span></blockquote>
    <p>Name a Foreign Key Constraint as <b>fk_</b>&lt;TableName&gt;</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>e.g.<br>
        <span class="code">PATIENTS</span> would have a Foreign Key constraint called <span class="code">fk_patients</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><i>Note - in general each constraint should have a similar name to the index 
      used to support the constraint.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  
</blockquote>
<p><b>Other Fields</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Without getting carried away, you can also apply a suffix to non key fields 
      where this is helpful in describing the type of data being stored.<br>
      e.g.<br>
      A  column used to store boolean (Yes/No) values can be given a _yn suffix: retired<b>_yn</b>, superuser <b>_yn</b>, driver<b>_yn</b><br>
      <br>
      In lookup tables an easy way to identify the main text field is to name 
      it as a singular version of the tablename<br>
      e.g.</p>
    <pre>asset_types.at_asset_type_id_pk   (Primary Key)
asset_types.at_asset_type         (Text field)
asset_types.at_network_yn         (boolean) </pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>SQL</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Type all SQL statements in lowercase, being consistent with capitalisation improves the caching of SQL statements. A common variant is to put only SQL keywords in capitals. </p>
    <pre>SELECT
   em_employee_id_pk,
   em_employee,
   ab_start_date
FROM
   employees em,
   absences ab
WHERE
   absences.ab_employee_id=employees.em_employee_id_pk;</pre>
    <p> You already have a unique prefix worked out for every table, so use the 
      same thing when an ALIAS is required - this makes the SQL much easier to 
      read.<br>
      <br>
      Always list tables in the FROM / WHERE clause in desired join order - even 
      with CBO you are giving the Query Optimiser less work to do.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>PL/SQL</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Prefix scalar variable names with <b>v_ </b><br>
      Prefix global variables (including host or bind variables) with <b>g_ </b> 
      <br>
      Prefix constants with<b> c_</b> <br>
      Prefix procedure or function call parameters (including sql*plus substitution 
      parameters) with <b>p_</b> <br>
      <br>
      Prefix record collections with <b>r_</b> (alternatively suffix with <b>_record</b>)<br>
      Prefix %rowtype% collections with <b>rt_</b> (alternatively suffix with 
      <b>_record_type</b>)<br>
      <br>
      Prefix pl/sql tables with <b>t_ </b>(alternatively suffix with <b>_table</b>)<br>
      Prefix table types with <b>tt_ </b>(alternatively suffix with <b>_table_type</b>)<br>
      <br>
      Suffix cursors with <b>_cursor</b><br>
      Prefix exceptions with <b>e_</b><br>
      <br>
      If a pl/sql variable is identical to the name of a column in the table Oracle 
      will interpret the name as a column name.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Packages</b><br>
      Prefix package names with PKG_<br>
      <br>
      Write one package for each table - named PKG_TABLENAME, put all other code 
      that logically belongs to the schema, but not to any particular table in 
      a single Schema package PKG_SCHEMANAME.<br>
      If, as is likely, more complex grants are required for different groups 
      of users then create an additional package for each workgroup - these should 
      contain no code just wrappers that call procedures/functions in the other 
      packages.<br>
      This gives a level of separation between the basic code and the user security/grants 
      and makes it easier to change one without breaking the other.<br>
      <br>
      A pl/sql function name like PAYROLL.TAX_RATE the word PAYROLL could refer 
      to either a schema or a package name. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Edit Replace</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>If you apply a naming convention and then decide to rename something it 
      is possible to use Edit-Replace to update the associated code. But consider 
      these two fieldnames:</p>
    <pre>area_codes.<b>ac_code</b> 
region_area_codes.r<b>ac_code</b></pre>
    <p>The columns are unique but one is a substring of the other!</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Instance</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Oracle database instance names are limited to eight characters. The first 
      two or three characters of the name should reflect the Application, with the remainder indicating the nature of the instance. <br>
      e.g.</p>
    <pre>Live instance   SSLive
Test instance   SSTest
Train instance  SSTrain
Data Warehouse  SSdw
Staging Area    SSsa</pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Data Files</b></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote> 
    <p>Name Data files so that they identify the instance and the tablespace.<br>
      <br>
      Each filename should end with a two digit numeric value starting with 01, 
      that is incremented by 1 for each new datafile added to the tablespace. 
      <br>
      Use the extension ".dbf"<br>
      e.g.</p>
  <pre>SSLive_temp01.dbf
SSLive_rbs01.dbf
SSLive_clinical01.dbf
SSLive_clinical02.dbf</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Tablespaces</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Avoid naming tablespaces according to time periods.<br>
      (Oracle never forgets a tablespace and SMON will scan the list of tablespaces 
      in TS$ every 5 minutes) For a partitioned datawarehouse, try to adopt a 
      strategy of recycling the tablespace names.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Redo Logs</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> The redo log is a separate file (not in the tablespace)<br>
      Name Redo Logs so that they identify the instance, group and member number 
      of the log. Use the extension ".log" <br>
      e.g. <br>
      <span class="code">SSLive_redo_01.log</span><br>
      <br>
      For more detail on the physical placement of files see Oracle <a href="syntax-ofa.html">Optimal Flexible Architecture</a> (OFA) </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Documentation</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Lastly - write and maintain a data dictionary for all data elements - rather 
      than just dumping the Oracle data dictionary into a text document 
      or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-relationship_model">Entity relationship diagram</a>  - you should also be defining the <i>business</i> meaning of each data item.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
  <p>RDBMS naming conventions can become the subject of endless debate - here 
      are a few last things to consider:<br>
      <br>
      Does your naming convention make names longer or shorter?<br>
      <br>
      <span class="code">PURCHASE_ORDER_DATE</span> versus <span class="code">PO_DATE</span><br>
      <br>
      Will you have novice users writing SQL against the database?<br>
      If so will they understand the meaning of things like <span class="code">PO_DATE</span><br>
      <br>
  Is the naming convention documented somewhere that everyone can find? If you don&rsquo;t plan to change it very often, drop the text right into a table <span class="code">SELECT * from Naming_Conventions;</span></p>

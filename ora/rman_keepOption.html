<p>How long to keep the backup and associated archived redo logs.<br>
  <br>
Syntax:</p>
<pre>     KEEP UNTIL TIME [=] '<i>date_string</i>' [LOGS | NOLOGS]

     KEEP FOREVER  [LOGS | NOLOGS]

     <u>NOKEEP</u>
</pre>
<p>Specifying LOGS will ensure  that all  the archived logs required to recover this backup (or copy ) will remain available for as long as the backup is available. </span></p>
<p>If you plan to restore and recover all data up until the current time then logs will be  required.</p>
<p>For a point in time backup e.g. to keep a historical record then use NOLOGS.</p>
<p>  NOLOGS is not valid if the backup is inconsistent.</p>

<p> Add a new record to a recordset.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      <i>expression</i>.AddNew
</pre>
<p> The Move methods move from record to record without applying a condition.</p>
<p> To find records that meet a specific condition — use a <span class="code"><a href="findfirst.html">Find</a></span> method to move from record to record. To locate a record in a table-type Recordset, use the Seek method. </p>
<p>If you move to another record without updating (with the <a href="rst-update.html">Update</a> method), your changes will be lost without warning.</p>
<p>When you open a Recordset, the first record is current and the BOF property is False. If the Recordset contains no records, the BOF property is True, and there is no current record.</p>
<p>If the first or last record is already current when you use MoveFirst or MoveLast, the current record doesn't change.</p>
<p>If recordset refers to a table-type Recordset (Access workspaces only), movement follows the current index. Set the current index by using the Index property. If you don't set the current index, the order of returned records is undefined.</p>
<p>You can't use the MoveFirst, MoveLast, and MovePrevious methods on a forward–only–type Recordset object.</p>
<p>To move the position of the current record in a Recordset object a specific number of records forward or backward, use the Move method.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre>Dim db As Database
Dim rst As Recordset

Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb")
Set rst = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", dbOpenDynaset)
      
With rst
   <b>.AddNew</b>
   !FirstName = "Fred"
   !LastName = "Bloggs"
   .Update
End With</pre>

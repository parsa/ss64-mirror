</head><body><h1>Union</h1>
<p> Combine the results of two (or more) SQL queries.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      [TABLE] <i>query1</i> 
         UNION [ALL] [TABLE] <i>query2</i>
           [UNION [ALL] [TABLE] <i>queryn</i> [ &hellip; ]]

Key
  <i>query1-n</i>    A <a href="select.html">SELECT</a> statement, the name of a stored query,
              or the name of a stored table preceded by the TABLE keyword. </pre>
<p>A UNION SQL statement  can merge the results of two or more queries, tables, and SELECT statements, in any combination. </p>
<p>The <span class="code">ALL</span> predicate will return all records including any duplicates. This will also make the query run faster. By default duplicates are not returned. </p>
<p>All queries in a UNION operation must request the same number of fields.</p>
<p>Use aliases only in the first SELECT statement - aliases are ignored in all but the first select. In the ORDER BY clause, refer to fields by what they are called in the first SELECT statement.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<p class="code">Select supplier_id, supplier_name<br>
From suppliers<br>
UNION<br>
Select company_id, company_name<br>
From companies<br>
ORDER BY supplier_name;</p>

On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters&rdquo; ~  Norman Maclean</a></i></p>

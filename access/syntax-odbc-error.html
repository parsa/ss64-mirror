<body><h1>Trapping Errors from ODBC operations</h1>
<p>Access client applications with a ODBC / SQL Server back-end, will sometimes produce error messages from ODBC. These  are often rather cryptic technical messages so it is good to trap them and provide a more user friendly message. </p>
<p>On a  bound form we can use create a <span class="code">Form_Error</span> routine to deal with these.</p>
<p>The <span class="code">Form_Error</span> subroutine in each Access form is automatically triggered by the <span class="code">On Error</span> event of the Form, while it is possible to write a separate <span class="code">Form_Error</span> subroutine for each form in the database, it is more practical and maintainable to place the bulk of the code in a separate Public Subroutine <span class="code">FormErrorHandler()</span> and store that in an Access module. </p>
<p>The <span class="code">Form_Error</span> subroutine can then become a 1 liner in each form where you need to trap ODBC errors.</p>

<body><h1>Globally replace the Font on all Access  forms.
</h1>
<p>In Windows 7,  the  bitmap fonts <i>MS Sans Serif</i>, <i>MS Serif</i> and <i>Courier</i> will not always resize to match the  per-user <a href="../nt/syntax-dpi.html">DPI setting</a>, This is because the size of bitmap fonts is set (and fixed) during setup, which can cause <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/developingfordynamicsgp/archive/2009/11/25/windows-7-bitmap-fonts-and-microsoft-dynamics-gp.aspx">unexpected</a> results.</p>
<p>In Access 2010 ClearType is defaulted to ON even if disabled in the OS (<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/405066/what-are-all-the-places-where-cleartype-can-be-disabled"><span class="code">RespectSystemFontSmooth</span></a>)<br>
In Access 2013 
ClearType is disabled due to incompatibility with tablets (which can be rotated) <br>
 This means that fonts from the ClearType font collection (Calibri, Cambria etc) will not look so good in Office 2013.</p>
<p> To replace the  font used in an existing database, the code below can be used to globally replace with a suitable True Type font such as <i>Microsoft Sans Serif</i>.</p>
<pre>Public Sub UpdateFonts()
On Error Resume Next

' Warning: this will globally change the selected font across all forms in the database.
' It is strongly recommended that you backup the database before running.

Dim dbs As Object
Dim obj As AccessObject
Dim frm As Form
Dim ctl As Control

Set dbs = Application.CurrentProject
' Loop through the AllForms collection.
For Each obj In dbs.AllForms
    DoCmd.OpenForm obj.name, acDesign
    Set frm = Forms(obj.name)

    ' Loop through the controls on each form
    For Each ctl In frm.Controls

        ' Change the Font of text boxes etc
        If ctl.ControlType = acTextBox Or ctl.ControlType = acComboBox Or ctl.ControlType = acListBox Or ctl.ControlType = acLabel Then
            If ctl.FontName = &quot;<b>MS Sans Serif</b>&quot; Then
                ctl.FontName = &quot;<b>Microsoft Sans Serif</b>&quot;
            End If
        End If
    Next
    
    Set ctl = Nothing

    ' Save the form
    DoCmd.Close acForm, obj.name, acSaveYes

Next obj
End Sub</pre>

<p> Events can be used to trigger a Macro or a block of VBA code. The most common event is <span class="code">OnClick</span> but there are many other listed below  for Forms and TextBoxes:</p>
<h2>Form Events:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>.OnActivate - The form or report receives the focus and becomes the active window.<br>
.OnApplyFilter - A filter is applied or removed.<br>
.OnClick - A user presses and releases the left mouse button over an object.<br>
.OnClose - A form or report is closed and removed from the screen.<br>

.OnDblClick - A user presses and releases the left mouse button twice over an object<br>
.OnDeactivate - The form or report loses the focus to different form or report (or any other database object).<br>
.OnDelete - The user performs some action, such as pressing the DELETE key, but before the record is actually deleted.<br>
.OnDirty - The contents of a form or the text portion of a combo box change. It also occurs when  moving between pages in a tab control.<br>
.OnDisconnect - <br>
.OnError - A run-time error is produced in  Access when the form has the focus. This includes Jet database engine errors, but not VBA run-time errors.<br>
.OnFilter - A form is opened and its records are displayed.<br>
.OnGotFocus - The object receives focus.<br>
.OnInsert - The BeforeInsert event occurs when the user types the first character in a new record, but before the record is actually created.<br>
.OnKeyDown - A user presses a key while a form or control has the focus.<br>
.OnKeyPress - A user presses a key while a form or control has the focus.<br>
.OnKeyUp - A user releases a key while a form or control has the focus.<br>
.OnLoad - A form is opened and its records are displayed.<br>
.OnLostFocus - The object loses the focus.<br>
.OnMouseDown - The user clicks the mouse button while the mouse pointer rests over the object.<br>
.OnMouseMove - The user moves the mouse over the object.<br>
.OnMouseUp - The user releases a mouse button.<br>
.OnOpen - A form/report is opened, but before the first record is displayed.<br>
.OnResize - A form is opened and whenever the size of a form changes.<br>
.OnTimer - Occurs for a form at regular intervals as specified by the TimerInterval property.<br>
.OnUndo - The user undoes a change.<br>
.OnUnload - A form is closed but before it's removed from the screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>TextBox events </h2>
<blockquote>
<p>.AfterUpdate - After data is changed in a control or a record is updated.<br>
.BeforeUpdate - Occurs before changed data in a control or record is updated.<br>
.Change - Occurs when the contents of the specified control changes.<br>
.Click - A user presses and releases the left mouse button over an object.<br>
.DblClick - A user presses and releases the left mouse button twice over an object<br>
.Dirty - The contents of the specified control changes. (programmatic changes don't trigger this event) <br>
.Enter - Occurs before a control  receives the focus from a control on the same form/ report (.Enter happens before .GotFocus).<br>
.Exit - Occurs before a control  loses the focus to a control on the same form/ report (.Exit happens before .LostFocus).<br>
.GotFocus - The object receives focus.<br>
.OnKeyDown - A user presses a key while a form or control has the focus.<br>
.OnKeyPress - A user presses a key while a form or control has the focus.<br>
.OnKeyUp - A user releases a key while a form or control has the focus.<br>
.LostFocus - The object loses the focus.<br>
.MouseDown - The user clicks the mouse button while the mouse pointer rests over the object.<br>
.OnMouseMove - The user moves the mouse over the object.<br>
.MouseMove - The user moves the mouse over the object.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>The value of these events can be read from VBA and (if set) will be &quot;[Event Procedure]&quot; or <i>MacroName</i> or &quot;=<i>expression</i>&quot;</p>
<p>Similar events are triggered for most other form/report objects (comboboxes, tickboxes etc)</p>
<pre>The order of events when opening and closing a form:
 
   OnOpen > OnLoad > Activate > <b>OnCurrent</b> > DeActivate > OnUnLoad > OnClose

 Load into Display   Has focus  Populate     Lost focus  Remove      Remove
  memory   on screen           current record            from screen from memory</pre>
<p> Now, because of this order of operations, you can <span class="code">cancel</span> an OnOpen event, but not an OnLoad (as it's already open), and similarly you can cancel an OnUnLoad  but not an OnClose.<br>
